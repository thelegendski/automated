oh yeah, lol.

it'll get fixed in `1.8.10` which will be released in the near future. revert back to version `1.8.4` for now.

if ski.js was fully finished, i would def agree that it is a terrible library.
ski.js is the best overall if we consider the costs an' benefits of all libraries. it's easier for development, basically the most efficient unless you're PixiJS an' use WebGL to draw the canvas, but lacks the sheer number of features that other libraries offer. if you're lookin' for a library packed with every feature, don't look to ski.js. if you're lookin' for a library that has the basic functions an' gets the job done, that's what ski.js is for.,

eh, it's got a long ways to go to bein' a finished product.

i could load all of the images on an `OffscreenCanvas` an' cache the `ImageData`, but wouldn't that be less efficient if i wanted a loadin' screen on the current canvas? i think i misunderstood you.
the function `set` creates an `OffscreenCanvas` on line 1092 that ski.js uses to draw.

it certainly does. lol, yeah, i do. the reason why i didn't overlay HTML for the HUD here is that i was on a time crunch an' didn't see the need to add an extra movin' part by interactin' with the DOM. is there a particular advantage of usin' the DOM over the canvas?

that i'll see if i can fix. the issue has been that KA forces me to check the events for the entire DOM instead of just the canvas. i think someone else has a fix for that, so i'll see what i can do.

that is a simple fix, but i personally like it which is why it has persisted across all versions. you can disable it with one line.
`canvas.onscoll = () => {}`

that's an easy fix. i'll change that in a pinch. i think you should be able to change `skiJSData`.

ski.js never claims to be the best canvas library for comprehensiveness an' dev experience. it isn't production-stable, so i think it's slightly unfair to treat it as a finished product. ski.js is the best canvas library overall when you consider efficiency, comprehensiveness, an' dev experience. if you want more comprehension an' mediocre performance, join the p5.js train. if you want crazy efficiency [much faster than ski.js] but a worse dev experience an' completely different from the PJS you're used to, PixiJS is the way to go.,

he's already messaged me privately on it.

it's portin' to KA that's the issue. the entire thin' is done off-KA on another platform (CodeHS) due to KA hatin' CoffeeScript (forces me to save an' reload everytime a change is made). the issue is that CodeHS has my full name on it, an' i can't exactly share that link. there's a link i can share that shows the finished product w/o the code which i will produce when i release. the current issue is portin' to KA. it's all set up, but the issue with Liftoff's compiler was that it sent arguments passed into `fmt.Println` to the console an' i modified it to send to an element instead so the user didn't need to open the console (or in the case they didn't have access to the console). KA must hate the technique i used or it doesn't work in the sandbox idk which. if Liftoff could work on that, i _think_ that's it.,

beyond provin' that the KA devs don't prioritize this community in the slightest regardless of the work involved, how difficult would it be to make the editor compatible with p5.js? technically you're manipulatin' the DOM which should arguably [in the perspective of the Guardians an' their moderation] only be done in the web environment, so PixiJS, Paper.js, ski.js, etc. are all possibilities for the editor since you essentially stripped it down to its bones in the respect of the compiler.,

@SP
how does the council know where you've gotten your code? it's one thin' to plagiarize code off KA since you can find it through reasonable means [how many others programs were created in an outdated language], but what if a more experienced programmer copies large portions of their program from ChatGPT? it's more than capable of producin' algorithms that could take days to complete an' programmin' in a webpage rather than PJS would make ChatGPT even more powerful. as some of the council members are Guardians, they should know that the members of the KA community aren't always honest an' simply relyin' upon their morals isn't the best idea.

rules are fine an' all, but they are only feared when they are enforced. i find this proposition of the council not only confusin' as Bob has stated but also impossible to enforce. there's no tool available on the internet that can accurately [key word] detect whether code was generated by an AI.,

you've already beat Drawlite.js by miles.

@Tuan
VEXCESS' library is absolutely terrible. suffers from the same rookie mistakes as everyone else's library. the `draw` function is done in the most inefficient manner. only Aliquis out of those 58+ programmers could beat ski.js. additionally, VEXCESS decided that those 58+ others need no credit (line 7 `All other code written by Vexcess`).

from the fact that you boast with an immature ego, i take it that you are the banned VEXCESS. regardless, realize that no one on KA will beat ski.js with just a couple weeks.,

you might press space || enter an' a panel pops up for you to type the numbers in based on how many colored dots you counted on the wallz.

correction, i have no clue why i phrased it like that.
here's my dilemna, i want different surfaces that aren't just rectangular; hence, the line-circle physix on my wip. what my head can't get 'round is how i'm gon' make the blox into irregular shapes. i've thought of maskin' the blox, but i have no clue if that will work or not. first, i'd have to mask the brix, but the part that i can't get my mind 'round is how where i'd position the image since everythin' is centered. lmk if you can think of smth else. might just create a new class called `Shape`, construct all the shapez [irregular blox] in a list called `shapez`. then when i load the level, the last bit will be cachin' all of the shape graphix. would have to place each shape by hand with RegEx parser, but that just might work.

considerin' it's an underground prison, go for a darker blue color on the brix.

if you have the time, could you make a darker colored brick background? i'll use it for a parallax feel.

sounds good, :D!
yeah, it need to at least be square.

i'm on a potato an' it didn't lag for the minute i used it.

one thin' that might be givin' you trouble is that KA doesn't reset `addEventListener` so you have to set `on[event]` instead if you don't want it to crash as you edit, but that's only for dev. 

i have no clue why it would be laggin' on your end. SVG is faster than canvas, an' the logic seems pretty straightforward. maybe cache all references to elements at the beginnin' of the script tag?,

smth that just came to mind.
first, how do control panels work?
second, i need the block graphix. they should have a pattern not determined by `random` so i can string 'em together in a long line, :). i need to do some magic ski stuff to make 'em work with my current level planz, so we'll see how that goes.
third, i think you're nearin' the end of what you need to do. i'll probs need your help with level creation once i get there, but in the meantime, could you spice up the how an' leaderboard scenez with some animation?

rlly? i'm surprised. i expected to be deducted heavily for messy code/lack of commentin'.

in theory, it is. the biggest issue is that other enemies are obstacle an' they are mobile. additionally, the whole map isn't set up in a grid form, so literally any common pathfindin' algorithm is thrown out the window. a freeform pathfindin' algorithm is the only option, but existence, much less implementation, of such an algorithm that is widely available to the public is none.

biggest issue there is performance, but that was certainly a possibility i overlooked. i'll look into that for the release.

i fixed that bug after i submitted the entry. just needed to move where the collisions took place, but your idea would've worked as well.,
DATE: 2023-02-06T00:00:58.178117Z | POST TYPE: REPLY
i fixed all of the issues with a few fixes.

buttons:
your issue is that the collision function is set to the wrong mode. you're usin' `rectMode(CORNER)` when the button is drawn, so the collision function needs to know the same. add the argument `0` after the other arguments in the collision function. you'll need an `else` statement afterwards to change the color back, but it works like a charm, ;p.

images:
not sure what went wrong with `draw` or the characters. uncomment the `load` function an' use the code below. lmk if you don't understand any of it or it still doesn't work.
```
let scene = 'load'
draw = () => {
    switch(scene){
        case 'load':
            load(graphics, 'hello')
        break
        case 'hello':
            menuScene()
    }
}
```,
DATE: 2023-02-05T23:52:29.215851Z | POST TYPE: REPLY
i'll be sure too, ;p.

so, the first one takes a point `{x, y}` an' checks to see if is in a rectangle `{x, y, width, height}`. the second does the same except for a circle `{x, y, size}`. they both return true if the point is inside of the shape. the first one just does a bunch of boolean checks, the second uses the distance formula to determine the distance of the point from the center of the circle relative to its size.

are you doin' that to annoy me with a fangirl approach? if so, it's very, very effective.,

oh, wow. didn't even know that happened. my bad there.

so, the short answer is not rlly. the way `randomSeed` works forces me to basically reinvent `random` in a rather inefficient manner an' with math i don't understand. i could make p5.js' code better, but it's a huge class rather than one function, so idk how that would go.

it's stored locally, but they're stored in whatever file location i have up at the time. the file search would take hours if i left it runnin' an' i have work to do that would hinder the search, =(. there's no order to the madness, so i can't just find the most recent script an' i forgot the name conveniently so i'm in deep trouble rn if i can't find it. might just recode it at this point an' that might work just as fine ngl.,

as to your note in the other thread on IPs, i can't find anywhere that GitHub states that it shows IPs to others.

every website you visit sees your IP [that includes GitHub] an' GitHub sees your general geolocation based on your IP [like every other website can; most certainly Google] [such as you live somewhere near Richmond in my case, but i live miles upon miles away in a suburb]. GitHub doesn't share location [SMV can testify lol] or IP based.

all info stated 'bove can be found in GitHub's privacy statement in case you wish to know deeper specifics or are still concerned. if they did share IPs, the 100 million+ devs on GitHub might not be there since they know much better than any of us the danger of publicly displayin' your IP address.

TL;DR GitHub doesn't show any info related to your IP includin' geolocation to others [unless you decide to], but stores it privately for GitHub's purposes.

if you still don't feel comfortable usin' GitHub, i'll see if there's another method we can communicate on KA w/o others seein'.,

DATE: 2023-01-30T10:27:08.888584Z | POST TYPE: REPLY
hi, :D!
yup. Bluebird's script has never truly worked an' the API was taken away so Liftoff's method doesn't work either.

so, yes an' no.
yes, there is a way, but it's certainly not easy by any means.
normally, you could just set the `src` of an image to the base64 data an' call it quits, but you're on KA an' that's a CSP violation.
to get 'round that, you'd have to draw the image off-KA on a canvas, get the `ImageData` that results, compress the image data, so it isn't a monster to save, then decompress the image data here an' draw it on the canvas with thumbnail.js. the compression part is not smth i'm familiar, but i'd be willin' to give it a go. if i could figure out how to do that, it'd pretty much be the equivalent of an Imagenator but not just for a singular data type (i.e. PNG or JPG). the compression would be hosted off-KA on GitHub.

optionally, you could just upload your image to wikimedia an' then display it with thumbnail.js. your screenshot is now on the internet for anyone else to use, but that's already the case with your webpage since it's under the MIT license.,

yup. what goes on behind the scenes to display KA graphix.

i have a demo here. literally the same as PJS.
`_*https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/5099165982179328*_`

nope. ES6 looks like this. there's more to learn, but it's not much for graphix devs.
```
function function_name (params) {
    //KA allows these
}
//an' this
const function_name = (params) => {
    //pretty much the same thin'
}
//what you might be used to
var function_name = function(params) {
    //good ol' KA nonsense
};
```

SMV's program was goin' to be converted after she released it, but given her current schedule she said she couldn't. to be clear, i could copy an' paste the exact same code into ski.js an' it would run fine. the only major difference that i encourage for graphix devs is function definitions [what i discussed 'bove]. i think i phrased it wrong 'fore. i strongly encourage the use of ES6+ syntax an' ski.js, but if you can't do it due to a busy schedule, i'm obviously not gon' be unreasonable. it shouldn't be too hard as you just declare functions differently. i can't rlly think of anythin' else you do differently.

sounds good to me, :D!
idrc if you decide to use the canvas API instead, but my library is more user-friendly.
three main reasons as to why.
1.) bigger projex can be created with ski.js' efficiency. PJS severely limits the creativity you can express with its terrible inefficient functionz.
2.) it's a learnin' experience. everyone can now use ES6+ syntax an' featurez which makes codin' easier, not harder or more complex. ski.js also has additional functionality [mostly filters an' the new `curve` function] that can open up new opportunities.
3.) last an' i think least, entries score higher if only by a slim margin. it just looks more impressive to some of the less experienced judges [every judge looks at every program].

sounds good to me, ;p.,

worse, laziness. they report to the chat thread but show no progress on their projex despite my urges to get movin'. i kicked 'em out lol an' went lookin' for peepz who ik would put in an effort.

so the site itself is a dauntin' prospect that's meant for professional developers an' i don't even know 1% of the website other than the rlly simple stuff. however, we use the easy part of the site. you create an account an' give us your username. we invite you to a repo [short for repository. it stores a bunch of code]. you accept the invite [there's a notification bell that automatically updates] an' go to the repo. click on the "Discussions" tab an' you'll find our chat thread there.

oh, smth that you might want to know is that you have to use the web environment/ski.js on my team [for reasons i can provide if you care to know 'em], *but* you pretty much code graphix as you would in PJS (i'm not even sure there would be any difference for you). your first challenge doesn't start 'till monday, so ask any questions you have 'till then, :D.,

did i ever claim that anyone did anythin' wrong [even KA]? i don't think so. all i agreed with is that KA's activity levels are at an all-time low. 

KA can handle the situation as they like; it's their site an' we live with their decisions. Emma can create whatever projex she wants to; that's her choice. can i still find it slightly curious that voterz shot this project to the top of the HL [which is no fault of Emma's]? i hope so.

hypothetically, let's say that i have a library. i add to this library for my entry to fit my needz, but the library as a whole wasn't created for the comp. is the addition still judged or no?

at what point can we not reuse code? i remember last year it was when the homepage was released, but wanted to see if there were any adjustments to that policy.

can we kick peepz off the team for not performin' even tho they're technically "active"? not just for a day or two, but for nearly a week where they have not touched their entry whatsoever despite constant proddin' from their captain to just start. i think a warnin' first would be prudent, but i wanted to see if i have that capability 'cuz i didn't sign up for a third of my team to vanish into thin air.,

the best way is to release a new version of the script an' set the version `@[version]` to the version you just created.

create a new release titled `0.0.1` with tag `v0.0.1` so GitHub will chill.

you can't grab two different contexts from the same canvas an' since i grab the first canvas element in the body with ski.js [reason why thumbnail.js works the way it does], the contexts clash. if i had to guess, you import ski.js first, then use WebGL.

a few notes 'fore we begin the first round.
while i cannot mandate anythin' for this team, i _strongly encourage_ that we all follow the standards below.
```
1. every project must be in the web environment. [if you are used to PJS, you will use ski.js, the canvas API, or whatever canvas library you wish to use as long as you can satisfy the requirement below]
2. every project must utilize ES6+ syntax if JS is used. [ES6+ might sound dauntin', but it doesn't make codin' more complex, only easier]
3. all code will be run through a beautifier 'fore it is submitted. super simple, super easy an' saves pointz.
```
i would be more than happy to help those who might need help with this transition, :D.

Samwise had been pretty solid last CoC. i don't expect to get snaked for any of my pix in the first two rounds, but we'll see. i think if anyone decides to snake you or DR, that would be a huge surprise an' loss for them. i need another [or backup] graphix dev, but i'm also tempted to take Chase earlier.

FF isn't on my list since ik that Henry already has him on his.

Liftoff won't be higher as web devs won't help unless the whole team is for web devs which won't happen due to the limited talent. TDJ an' Lemon could rlly switch places, but i think TDJ might be more prized by other captains, so Lemon would be second.,

those users have nowhere to go. there's no site with KA's content. Python 3.0 was slower on the backend not frontend so we'll never truly see the impact but KA will. if KA improves or learners on every other section of KA except the KACP are able to excel better than they could 'fore (or even just one section), then it's worth it. the issue is that KA has just gone downhill. very few badges [hundreds less iirc]. no more backgrounds. crazy buggy discussion platform. all of these *hurt* learners. KA wants to die. that's their mission.

the very definition of bandwagon. someone hasn't been on KA recently:

it's gotten worse, but it's out of our hands unless we hire a private investigator or report Y to the authorities in some other fashion but i don't think we'll ever get enough to dox Y on our own.

the situation hasn't entirely resolved itself, but we're currently stuck between a rock an' a hard place with no progress over the past few days. at this point, i can't do much else other than sit an' watch.

i won't mention names for reasons i'm sure you will understand, :).

i was approached by a user, i'll call him X, a lil' bit ago that there was an urgent situation regardin' bots. a user who you know, i'll call him Y, had been generatin' bots over a prolonged period of time. 1 million bots. X had created his own bots, but not for the malicious purposes that Y had an' shared his bot gen script with me. they were quite similar to that of Y, if not better. sent most of what we knew to KA (what i've said here. there's more but i can't discuss that here.) as well as the developments that have occurred over the past week or so to get 'em to stop the creation of bots entirely. KA did what KA does best. i'm sure you have an idea what that would be.

if you want to know more, i've added info on my GitHub bio (github . com / thelegendski).

i've resumed development on all collabs (an' added another one to the list, smh), so there should be progress soon, :D.,

@DR
i'll sum it up for you.

WKoA has refused to comply with the ToS that he agreed to. this caused quite a conflict with the Guardians an' still does.

a lil' over a week ago, i was quite unhappy with CL (i think you saw) for the poor effort that he continually puts into his projects. the thread got out of hand an' i deleted it. in that thread, WKoA popped up an' i left a rather snarky comment for him. i had originally left a much harsher comment in the Khancorrenza "trash" thread, but it was hidden for whatever reason an' consequently deleted.

it ought to be noted that he took rather drastic measures when he wasn't banned by postin' a highly controversial flag an' intentionally targetin' the "liberal" population of this site. he has noted that his sole goal is to eradicate the site of LGBTQIA+ programs.

in the Khantober thread which has been deleted due to spam, i had attempted to post another snarky comment to a user who had been banned comparin' him to WKoA. the attempt never followed through, but a project with my post in the comments remained. WKoA found the post an' decided to leave a comment of his own. he alerted the Guardians of my "rude" behavior (who acknowledged his alert), but over the past 3 days no action has been taken. i've been harassed since.

let me know when you see this an' respond as you see fit. this project may be deleted at any time in the near future as you are aware of the situation which should be sufficient. i would prefer to leave WKoA banned if possible.,

KA already stores the project data on their end without the need of your replit. i deleted it so you'd stop poppin' up.

you're startin' to sound more an' more like Drained.

dude, lay off.

it's an online _learnin'_ platform, but your sole goal is to discriminate against another group. LGBTQIA+ are still people. they're just like you an' me. just 'cuz you don't agree with 'em doesn't mean you get to wage war.

you're stubborn an' insensible simply due to your ignorance of others an' the rules set in place by the Guardians. go make your own learnin' platform if you don't like KA.,

i have the right to freedom of speech. if you don't like what i have to say, ignore it.

the reason why i don't capitalize "i" is due to the stress it puts upon oneself. i see it as selfish. in addition, it makes the glorious Name of our Heavenly Father stick out a bit more, no?

@YIVauEivoj YIVauEivoj
the Guardians are rather indiscriminate of what they hide based on _users_. now, discrimination against the content of the program rather than the Guidelines is quite arguable, but that's for another day somewhere else.

they have hidden `externals` every single time it pops up on the HL up until, well, now. they might have the weekend off, or maybe they've decided it isn't worth their time. perhaps Guardians are leavin' due to KA's executives (see KA's Glassdoor reviews) an' now they're understaffed. whatever the reason is, the outcome is the same. these projects have yet to be hidden.

@HSstudent16
i wonder if they would let wikimedia images fly...
on another thought, i wonder what their restrictions against API calls from PJS will be.

i've been told by Evan that *any* use of `externals` will be hidden from the HL, regardless of its actual use. perhaps the policy changed without notice.,

there actually isn't a "canvas" method.

there are two methods. Polar's stubborn method (which Henry originally used) an' the stylesheet method.

Polar's method calls the font in a script, but you have to have the link to the font's file in Google's server in order to use it rather than just the name.

i prefer usin' the `link` method which you normally use. 
`<link href = 'font link here' rel = 'stylesheet'>`
then call `textFont(fontNameInStringForm, fontSize)`
you don't need to wrap the font name with `createFont`.

you may ask, why not add a `loadFont` function? the reason is that the page doesn't load twice, so if the `draw` function isn't used an' the `text` function not made `asynchronous` (which would screw so many more things up) your font would never load an' the text would be set to the default `sans-serif`.,

heyo, :D!

i think either Liftoff or Leviathan invented the method. i've used it for the mountaintop homepage an' trava, an' i must tell you that it's a pain to deal with, hence thumbnail.js.

anyways, here's how it works. 
```
1.) grab your base 64 image data. 
2.) open the *Network* tab in your browser's console
3.) you should see a request sent that begins with your project ID. *right-click* on it.
4.) under the *Copy* menu, select *Copy as fetch*
5.) go to the *Console* tab. 
6.) *paste* the data
7.) there should be a long string containin' the base 64 image data (under the "image_url" key tho don't look for "image_url" as the JSON object isn't well formatted). *replace* the base 64 image data with yours (note that it only works with PNGs an' GIFs).
8.) *press enter* to send the request
9.) *enjoy* you hard earned thumbnail! 
```
once you've done it, it's pretty straightforward. just make sure that you have saved a copy of the base 64 image data in case you need to make changes to the webpage after release, :).,

i went through some of your code an' will continue to further make it efficient in the future. you can easily manipulate arrays like so (tho in the web environment, it's much easier).
```
//copy arrays
Array.prototype.copy = function(){
    return this.concat();
};
var a = [1, 2, 3];
var b = a;
b.push(4);
println(a);
println(b);

//check if two arrays are equal to each other
Array.prototype.equals = function(arr){
    if(this.length === arr.length){return this.every(function(item, index){return item === arr[index];});}
};
var a = [1, 2, 3], b = [2, 2, 3], c = [2, 2, 3];
println(a.equals(b));

so, i ran the project at the maximum possible speed that `setInterval` would go, an' i got this.
`_*https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/themischeviouspachyderm/projects*_`

lucky for me, i had the ingenious idea of lookin' at the network tab in my browser's console. here's the good news an' the bad news.
good news: so, it is doin' as i said above where it's sendin' multiple requests to KA, but not for the reason i thought. whenever KA tries to create a new webpage, it errors out as the script runs over it to an extent. the only issue is that the webpage is still saved. so, KA tries to continuously create new webpages until smth clicks on their end.
bad news: 
a.) i now have an alt filled with 20+ programs of a singular project.
b.) i only saw 4 projects error out, but as you can see, there are way, way, way more. took a good 20 seconds to save the project.
c.) someone could use it to boost their project on the HL by simply creatin' a ridiculous amount of spin-offs.

edit: nevermind, i just tried with an alt an' 120 spin-offs didn't move it on the HL at all.,
DATE: 2022-04-07T14:06:08.704342Z | POST TYPE: REPLY
yup!

a few ways to do it.
a.) go online an' find a PNG to base 64 converter (there are tons out there). i even know one on KA if you want the link.
b.) if you want to copy a KA project to base 64 data, you'll need to use some `canvas` element methods. here's an idea of how one would do it in PJS.
```
//top of code.
var externals, canvas = externals.canvas;
//end of code.
//you'll need the browser's console as println is a lot more resource intensive an' will crash your browser.
debug(canvas.toDataURL());
```

just remember that your file shouldn't exceed 750kb. otherwise, KA won't take it.,

i believe you once said that you're a master of overengineerin' or smth of the sort. i must be your apprentice.

'cuz accessin' `canvas` is much more fun. who doesn't want to create an HTML image element in PJS without HTML? found a hybrid. the legitimate reason as to why is that i can use the same method for wikimedia images, so that means i could create a function for both.

edit: on second thought, yours is much easier to incorporate elsewhere.

lol, yes and no. yes, we have a basic premise. no, we have no real characters. my best shot is below, but i'm not the greatest in the creativity department, :p.

your name is ____ (jake? or something gender-neutral like charlie?). you wake up one morning in your small quaint town of Tutol. (note all proper nouns that are not names were generated by my random word generator. `_*https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/5123081716596736*_`) as you walk outside a neighbor stops and tells you about the horrifying news. the precious cottonball (something silly, it was the first thing it thought up of) that your great-great-grandfather had prized had been stolen from the local museum. (perhaps this is all a cutscene and the cutscene ends here?) you have to go talk to Bob (he'll look like a character graphic one of my friend's made.) to learn that he lost his lucky coin (penny?) in the garden nearby. you go into the garden and find the lucky coin which you give to Bob. Bob then gives you a book to give to the librarian in the library (most likely in a separate world map). the librarian gives you a coin that you spend at a local breakfast stop for a donut. you give the donut to Winston who gives you a taco. the taco is given to the mayor who is starving after his house flooded due to some squirrels triggering his fire alarm. the mayor gives you a key to an old room in the library that you open to find a pair of glasses on the floor. you bring the pair of glasses to an old man (not too far from Bob) who gives you a key to go to the upper floor in the breakfast shop. you go up to find the prized cottonball waiting in the middle of the hallway. the game ends when you take the cottonball back to its rightful place in the museum. that transitions to the end scene which says "you may have found the cottonball. but who stole it?" i was thinking that it could be the squirrels, Bob, or the mayor. i would need to write all of this dialogue out, but i think this is a good start.,

Alright, I do have a couple of suggestions.

1.) Trees need to have a spawn variable, so we can add levels with more difficulty as the plot progresses.

2.) I would suggest making the bullets the same color, so they might be distinguishable.

3.) They should have spurts (every 250 frames or so) in which they spray a certain amount of seeds and bullets per say 1 seed and 3 to 5 bullets based on difficulty. Seeds should have a chance of dying as well.,

Spawning is automatic, so there is a timer that goes off. Summoning is the ability to create an enemy while the timer has not gone off for that enemy.,

Ah, okay. Well, I'll think of something. The hard part is getting the badge on the outside down. After that it's a little too easy. Adidas's logo is just a quad and Nike's a bezier. Perhaps something that I could add some screen shaking, particles, and animation too. That might be worthy of 10+ votes. (I had found out that if you use a logo/brand someone is familiar with, then they usually vote up more.)

It would be much easier if you made the trees in this format rather than having so many variables within the function.

var graphic = function(x,y,s,r){
pushMatrix();
translate(x,y);

rotate(r);

wow, this looks like a kacp need of revival, smh.

edit: ia, levi f., _and_ CowboyFan_ on your tail. i'll link a post of mine below. this message was not directed at you when posted. doubt you'll read it or respond, but worth a shot.

"The hardest problem about Khan Academy is its breeding ground for sociology. What I mean by that is, you put thousands and thousands of users onto a single platform over ~ten years, and as that platform ages, you see a growth, climax, and the eventual decline. Now, the KACP (as defined by Willard [the creator of MineKhan] who I had a similar discussion with) is most like a representative democracy, not necessarily a republic by technical definition. This means that all of the voters (below 13 or "childed" and above 13) select which programs will receive their vote. Now, the government urges voters to stay informed, so that come election time, you know what you're voting on.(I believe it is reasonable safe to believe that you live in the United States of America.) More accurately, voters choose which creators will receive their votes. Now by the connotation most often used, "voter fraud" is not plentiful on KA and is nearly non-existent as no specific instance (that follows the connotation) has been recorded. A separate wholly unique and unprecedented issue plagues KA, quality. Effort and time are thrown aside when choosing which programs are selected as "hot". Voters choose whichever program pleases, entertains, or brings the most enjoyment to them, so the best solution for this aspect is to keep the voter informed as to the need for supporting programs that require an intense effort as opposed to those that do not but bring the same entertainment value if you will. This task will be incredibly difficult to accomplish due to the natural desires of the users based on previous voting history, and the fact that no one has decided to address this issue which I find beyond appalling. In conclusion, I will probably inform the viewer of the necessity of supporting the programs that required an "intense effort".

Now the other issue that is much more plausible to fix is that there are low-quality projects in the first place. There are two causes to this issue, and I will address both. The first is that new programmers feel left out and wish to be known like all of these other programmers. It can be pretty intimidating when someone realizes just how difficult it is to garner votes and attention. As Lin Gh. put it (I assume you know who she is.), (note that this is a paraphrase) "It isn't a bad thing to want votes." There are much, much worse ways to get votes, and a platformer template or two or a meme here and there won't bring Armageddon, but it is most certainly a cause of alarm. Either the programmer feels this desire to be popular without effort (unsolvable from our position), or the desire to be popular with effort but no one willing to pay attention. Hence, the best way to solve this issue is to constantly monitor the "Recent" list and vote on projects vote-worthy, regardless on whether or not they are noticed.

The last cause is that these programmers may have the capacity to become stellar programmers, but are lacking the assistance needed to create such projects. These would be projects that may not seem quality at the surface, but to the user seem to the utmost standard. The best way to solve this issue is to help as many users as possible which KA has conveniently built a system in just for that. Help requests and discussion questions are being answered frequently, and help is in abundance, so what is the problem? We are neglecting to help those who don't feel comfortable to post help requests, perhaps out of fear of being insulted for being "so dumb" (which I have found a user who did as said recently) or of "not being good enough". I might seem to be taking this to an extreme, but you cannot deny the reality that the KACP is facing. (If you would like me to hunt down the post, I would be glad to.) How do you help someone who doesn't ask for it? How do you meet a need that you don't even know exists? By providing constructive, positive feedback that nurtures those programmers to their fullest potential regardless if they ask. Now, you shouldn't tell them that what they are doing is wrong, but rather suggest that there is a better way. If someone seems to have a hit a roadblock, go the extra mile and fix it for them regardless if they ask. If a user sees this as intrusive, then we will respect their wishes, but unless otherwise noted helping, supporting, and caring are the best options."

edit: it is more frustrating then anything for me, but consider the other novice programmers that could have made it on the HL if your program hadn't taken up a spot. what if the next GG is just waiting to be found but can't find the motivation without being noticed? please be considerate of others.,

"Dark.js hopes to fix a few technicaly issues with ski.js, be much faster than ProcessingJS, but also add new features that make using Dark.js worth it"

love to see the grind, man. openin' an issue on ski.js would be too easy, a PR that just fixed the issue would've been laziness, you had to recreate the library from scratch.

saw this on GitHub 'fore i saw it here believe it or not.

i've spent over a year on ski.js an' it's not just my knowledge that went into that project but the enormous wealth of knowledge the greatest programmers on KA possess. PT, HS, Polar, bravo bravo, the names go on an' on. VEXCESS an' Polar miserably failed at their own creation; i'd love to see what you come up with, but i will warn you that it's next to impossible to beat 10+ programmers over a year as one person in a month or so. 

at the very least this project is a worthy endeavor, :). it's noteworthy for one to want to create their own canvas library. it's another to claim you'll beat ski.js.,

first, i don't fully understand the Web Audio API so if you could explain what `AudioContext`, `AudioBuffer`, `AudioBufferSourceNode`, an' `GainNode` are, it would be much appreciated, :D!

second, i'm not sure what you did, but what text does the audio need? it doesn't look like it's base64 encoded. i think i could figure out the rest from there, but i'm stuck as to how i would recreate this in a faster environment [the web environment with imported scripts]. i can have the string size be as long as necessary, but i can't run your C++ code as i'm stuck on a chromebook atm.

DATE: 2022-09-17T18:40:34.792089Z | POST TYPE: COMMENT
i'm sorry Jake. i just had to tear this to pieces once i saw the code.

first, the compliments.

absolutely beautiful transitions, :D! wonderfully unique, distinct an' most certainly eye catchin'.

that Lorenz attractor is quite nice, ;p.

an' then, we all saw it comin'.

this is actually one of the only programs of yours where i feel that there was a lack of effort, or perhaps you were rushed. either way there is _a lot_ to be improved upon an' i've only listed the few (okay, several) things that jumped out at me.

a.) the font choice might blind some users. with this color scheme, it just doesn't mesh. at all.

b.) black an' white do not work. don't do it. unless you're goin' all out with the design of the webpage you *cannot* sacrifice color.

c.) the cacteye avatar is in side of a neat little box that nearly blends with the background. make it pop out by borderin' it with white instead of puttin' black on black.

d.) the use of green on this webpage, particularly that shade of green, just does not mesh again. the colors should pop out without bein' an eyesore.

e.) you're in the web environment. _use it._ ES6+ syntax is available to you with extra benefits, but instead you settled for good ol' painful ES5.

f.) while i complimented your transitions, you also did it in the most painfully complicated manner. simply chainin' the animations an' displays with `onanimationend` would've worked beautifully without causin' the code to look like Greek.

g.) your backgrounds are plainly just pasted into the webpage as if you just picked the first search result. a webpage should be a harmonious symphony of color not chaos.

h.) there should only be two animations, at the very most 4. once the user hovers over the element, once the user moves out of the element, an' optionally, once the user clicks on the element. perhaps there could be an intro or `onscroll` animation as well, if deemed necessary. on the news page, you change from the terrible black an' white to an even harsher blue an' white to a blindin' green an' white that bobs up an' down an' screams "look at me steal your vision from years to come!".

i.) JSONP an' callback functions are much easier to use than _jQuery_. the KA devs can't get their implementations straight. the creator of _jQuery _leads the KA devs. what does that say 'bout _jQuery_? additionally, it's more of an easy way out, so to speak.

j.) space out operations. instead of `1+1` write `1 + 1`.,

i would think that this would be a slightly more efficient implementation on lines 42 to 51:
```
const styles = document.getElementsByTagName('style-sass')
for(const style of styles){
    Sass.compile(style.textContent, result => {
        const style = document.createElement('style')
        style.innerHTML = result.text
        document.head.appendChild(style)
    })
    style.remove()
}
document.body.style.display = 'block'
```,

nf.constructor("$('canvas').on('wheel', e => e.preventDefault())")();

i lost half my team at the start of a competition an' then found replacements. well, some of the original team an' the replacements dropped out, so i'm back to half a team. lookin' for any an' all replacements rn.

to be very clear, i'm not askin' for a time commitment. i'm not askin' for a full-time member who grinds day in an' day out without sleep to crank out what they can. two to three hours a week would be appreciated, or not even that, any an' all help, no matter the perceived insignificance, is greatly appreciated. an example would be just the buttons for a menu, not the menu itself.

it's totally fine if you can't, but thought it would be worth a shot, :).,

hey Levi, :D!

call me crazy, but there's a difference between desperation an' craziness.

i've lost half my team in CoC [again] [Fer Fer, SMV, an' Promise] an' i need some help. not a full-time captain, not a full-time member. i need someone who can contribute 2 to 3 hours of code a week, which given your current projex makes you an opportune candidate. you don't even have to be active for two to three hours a week or make any commitment, even a lil' help [just buttons or a singular enemy graphic] would go a long way, :).

totally understand if you don't want to an' call me crazy for recruitin' the ex-rival cap'n, but it was worth a shot.,

hey Argon, :D!

so, i have a favor to ask of you. 'round this time last year i was in dire straits for an annual competition, an' i asked for you to create a menu [which wasn't used due to my inactivity over the weekend]. 

well, that same annual competition has come back an' this time i have found myself in a pickle. granted picklez have to take time to well, pickle, an' this came along quite rapidly so maybe it's a cuke [cucumber]?

probs belongs in questions but whatevs.

so 21262 has asked to join my team, but there's currently some debate over the matter. if you could tell him, that i [more like we] am considerin' his proposition but have not come to a definitive conclusion yet. i'm currently not a fan of the idea that participants get to choose their teams as you've taken a hard stance on the matter with Phantom Falcon last year an' your note to SMV this year. cap'ns should have the say imho, but that's just my two cents an' this isn't my comp, ;p.

how do you level the playin' field out if not all teams can have 7 members an' all members of team Henry want to still participate? i don't think it'd be fair to tell any member of team Henry that they can't participate anymore, but if they do, do the teams who have 6 rather than 7 members get to recruit more? that sounds like a decent idea since all teams are somewhat back to where they started but also are somewhat in a better position. just tryin' to figure out how it all works out, :).,

how would you have improved the enemy algorithm? the movin' aspect would've required a freeform pathfindin' algorithm of which there is no documentation anywhere on the web. the attack an' movement could be triggered by when the player is close enough to the enemy, but i don't think that is what you had in mind as that's literally one line.,

lovin' the simple homepages just like last year, :D.

good luck to you an' your team, :).

a few notes on the code.
1. do you not indent the tags inside of the `head` or `body` tag?
2. it's terribly inefficient to use `querySelector`, so here's a quick fix for lines 205 to 206 in case you care to. [line 211 will need to be `for(const el of links)`]
```
const cursor = document.getElementsByClassName('cursor')[0]
const links = document.getElementsByTagName('a')
```
3. curious to know why you wrap the `event` parameter `e` in parentheses when it isn't necessary. is it better codin' practice?
4. any particular reason why you wrapped your `link` tags with a `div`?,

to answer your first question, it simply isn't efficient to do so. i would need to record every random value possible an' assign those values accordin' to when the function was called which is not safe as the number of times the random numbers were called varies. the only other way would be to inefficiently employ the same method as PJS. i don't think it will matter too much, but i can manually adjust the random values for each tree if you feel like we need `randomSeed` i could try to import PJS, but that's too much of a headache.

as to your second point, you have two conditionals at once for `i` in your `for` loop. you need two different `for` loops as the first conditional for TRAVA ends first, so the same number of characters (5) is what is displayed of TELENOVA. all strings come with a built-in property `length` so there's no reason to `.split('')`, :).,

somebody already voted this who wasn't me, o.o.

just a couple things i learned from _tutol_.
a.) i'd probs make the enemy & npc objects separate.
b.) i have a typin' function we could use to make it look nice. this also means that the dialogue logic is nuts. here's how i set it up previously, tho we should probs make it more efficient. all of the npc data was stored in an array title, well, _npc_data_.
```
/**
 * list of variables and what they do for NPC dialogue:
 * in @Player:
     * this.listen checks to see if the player is listening.
 * in @NPC:
     * this.dialogue is the array of dialogue for the NPC.
     * this.talking is the boolean to determine whether or not
       the NPC should update the typing/talking.
     * this.done is the boolean for whether the talking is done
       for the NPC.
     * this.phew is the boolean for whether the talking is done
       for the player.
     * this.check is the boolean "loading" the dialogue before
       talking.
     * this.given controls whether or not the player has been
       given the object needed.
     * this.have is the boolean for whether or not the player
       has the item the NPC wants.
     * this.checkered is a boolean made to make sure that the
       second dialogue is typed and that it isn't repeated.
     * this.type is the constructor for type.
 * in @type:
     * this.t is the wanted text.
     * this.txt is the returned text.
     * this.char is the character that this.txt is on of this.t
     * this.del is whether or not text is being deleted.
     * this.speed is how fast the text is written.
     * this.done is whether or not the text is done being typed.

c.) just as a note, i find it easier to make a `prototype` called `all` that has every function in it.

_when_ do i get to see the program?

edit: i did what you did in three lines, >:). don't call global variables inside functions. that makes them useless elsewhere.
```
function when(val,min,max){
    return val >= min && val <= max ? true : false; 
}
```

edit edit: what you did in three lines with all of the code including your global, >:).

function when(val,min,max){

two things.

a.) your collisions are off. start on the right side of a block with the block above you and you will get stuck when moving left.
b.) instead of constantly creating a `new` instance of `Player`, just set `p.x` to `j * 20` & `p.y` to `i * 20`,

first an' foremost, it allows us to create bigger projex without bein' limited by PJS.

second, everyone will be able to employ more advanced programmin' concepts which opens a learnin' opportunity.

glad you enjoy it, :D!

`window.open` is the key. relevant code is on lines 695 to 707.

1. open the window an' assign it to a variable. `const win 
= window.open()`
2. open the document for that window. `win.document.open()`
3. write the contents of the current webpage into the document. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is standard practice for all webpages which is followed by the `outerHTML` [includes the tag of the element] of the `html` tag. `win.document.write("<!DOCTYPE html>" + ${document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].outerHTML})`
4. close the document since we're done writin'. `win.document.close()`
5. this is a unique aspect of my fullscreen functionality. set the `fullscreen` attribute of the new `window` to true [`!0` is a shortcut of sorts]. `win.fullscreen = !0`.

based on whether the `fullscreen` attribute is true i display the fullscreen icon, therefore you can't open a new screen once you're already in fullscreen mode.,

that's the issue. you'd have to know the previous endpoints to utilize 'em.

there's actually quite a lot on spin-offs currently in the API, _BUT_ it seems that KA goes off the data initially set, so it can't be changed (a.k.a. i've already tried). width an' height can be changed after the program is initially saved, as well as thumbnail, in normal conditions but the content type won't.,

a better question would be if you want rage's collisions in particular or just circle-rect collisions. i've optimized the collisions further in the `collision.js` addon of ski.js, but here's the code from rage.

the first thin' to consider is that you're forced to work in a module which isn't attached to the global scope. line 2694 wouldn't work.

`fps` is a global variable that defines fps instead of `this.__frameRate`.

event listeners haven't always worked properly, so you'll need to add the `event` parameter. instead of `mousebutton`, `e.button`. instead of `key`, `e.key`. instead of `keyCode`, `e.keyCode`.

i don't see anythin' else right away.
ski.js doesn't differ from PJS that much. it only opens the door for more complex JS. i'll get back to you with Embers in ski.js when i get the chance.

i've never personally reached the character limit, but i've been told that the file size of any program cannot exceed 1MB. savin' will simply error out an' the "save" button will be stuck on "saving..."

the best way is to store all code on GitHub. there are issues with this such as the need to constantly test an' tweak code. i would work on chunks of the code at a time. due to the limitations an' restrictions of this environment (particularly the scope of exported variables), there are quite a few workarounds necessary for different situations.

if you want a surefire method that would only last for a few months (perhaps less), you could simply abuse (not literally) the API.,

could i have a link?

three ideas that come to mind.

a.) blank nodes were needed for older browsers (specifically IE), but KA no longer supports IE so idk (they've also made some pretty darn silly dev mistakes, so i wouldn't put it past 'em havin' things that don't need to be there).

b.) blank nodes could just be empty `script` tags for imported scripts or `link` tags for stylesheets. it depends on which nodes these are.

c.) since you're in a sandboxed `iframe`, we don't have full access, so they could've restricted the capability of webpages to read the nodes.

unless smth changed, i think you should still be able to access what you need without encounterin' the blank nodes. i would at least be able to find a workaround for you, :).
