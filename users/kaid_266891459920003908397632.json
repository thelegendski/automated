Never, _ever_ gonna happen, hahaha.

If someone randomly asked me what book I was reading, I'd be much more likely to respond in a remotely human way (as opposed to looking up like a weary demon and sprinting away [okay, this might _possibly_ be _slightly_ exaggerated. I might only run away, not necessarily sprint ;p]) than if someone said \"hi\" xD\nOn a final note, while getting others to talk is a fantastic way to work on social skills, I do not think it's the best way to form a friendship.

Tell me I'm good and I won't even try.\n\nIf you didn't get angry, where's the line between right and wrong going to be drawn? Laws exist to smooth down righteous anger. If there was no anger, why have laws? Why have stop signs, right? Oh, someone will die because the cars will crash into each other... But if people just got sad and not mad, not _angry,_ they wouldn't bother gaining justice; they'd just accept it and move on. The problem will never be fixed. Really, without anger, society is nothing. We would be at a point where nothing progresses. We _need_ it. \nWe can't \"forgive\" someone if we are unable to recognise the mistake. How do we recognise a mistake? Because it makes someone angry. And that anger is justified. \nForgiveness cannot come without sin and sin cannot be encountered without fury.\n\nI'm not going to say anything about the rest of your message nor promote a discussion on religion on a learning website :P\n\no.O","edited":true,"deleted":true},{"date":"2023-01-26T20:47:02.572027Z","msg":"Yupp :D\n\nHuh...
