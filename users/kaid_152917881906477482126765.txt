i did a bit of a physics overhaul, sorry about that. make sure to note that some parts of these physics are borrowed from ski (like a line or two though, nothing huge).

the movement right now is trash, you can always change it if you see fit. it's just to test the camera right now, i'm aware that the final version will have a different movement system.

? DATE: 3/6/2023, 3:22:21?PM
didn't say mine was better, i said it was first.

this is a better option:
```
function capsToggle(str) {
  return str.split("").map(c => Math.random() > 0.5 ? c.toUpperCase() : c.toLowerCase()).join("");
}
```
and i'm sure ski could go better than that.

mine was first tho >:D

Literally the same kind of layout you did last year. Design choice is up to you, but preferably make it give off some sort of different vibe than the one you made last year.

Sorry this is kind of vague, it's just the same competition so it'll have the same basic needs. Home, About, Participants, Leaderboard, etc. Maybe include a separate schedule page if it's possible where we can list out the challenges in more detail.

it's going to be difficult. the thought right now is that we'll use an off-KA API library to grab the posts, and then maybe use another library to auto-update the program.

we'll figure something out though, it's not doable to simply manually update after each T&T is posted :P

you probably can, it's just not how i do things. if i had to guess why, it's because you have to check and change the y of every block before you can change any x. not sure why, but it's definitely strange.

:D

not any large ones besides they should be like creatures and such. the WCC ones are a good example, but they should probably look a bit more professional than some of those xD

there were, and i'd probably prefer you doing six as well. there are a ton of applicants (like more than 200 last year), so it's good to have as many teams as possible.

what am i supposed to do, _argue_?

yep :D
yeah, if you could make them so that each stage is just easily positionable and stuff it would be great. i can take care of making them thumbnail-ready.

no animation, just 5 static stages for each avatar would be fine.

thank you! that sounds great. idk whether ski was thinking six like last year, but starting with five different avatars sounds like a great idea.

i appreciate it :)
? DATE: 3/1/2023, 1:53:43?PM
indentation is hugely important. the sad thing is that a lot of people don't realize that they can literally just run their code through a formatter before they show it off to the world.

like you can write the sloppiest code ever but at least have the decency to run it through a formatter. little to no work for you, and it saves a lot of confusion when other people look at your code.
? DATE: 3/1/2023, 12:54:03?PM
yes you are lol

it's ok if you don't think you'll have the time.
they would just be like the previous avatars for primavera. some mythical creatures.
last year: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/primavera-2022/6556387095134208

the same sets have been reused a few times and i don't really want to do that again :P
sayy the 18th? sooner is better than later.
just a random bag of fierce-looking creatures. last year, the team i was on was called Terratrice, and they had a mean-looking golden eagle. ski's team was called Mountaintop, and they had a weird lizard thingy. just look at previous ones for inspiration.

and by all means if you feel like it's too much, that's fine! i know you got a lot on your plate.

Was kind of my fear. There's a lot of crap going on behind the scenes that'll mess things up pretty easily if you don't know exactly what you're doing - and to that end, even if you know what you're doing.

Keep your program up though, I could take a look and tell you what's going wrong. Chances are it's the image loading.

it's been great working with you too, you made some pretty dope art that kinda makes the game what it is :)

@Akbaba
we thought about an infinite world but in the end it just would have suffered from lag issues because we couldn't handle it properly. I'm going to make the world as large as I can without noticeable frame decrease, but it's not gonna be infinite.

as for the axe, i think that's a good idea. I'll try to figure something out for that.
? DATE: 2/27/2023, 12:59:26?PM
i don't think that would fit very well. i could try to put it on the loading screen, but that might lag a bit because i wouldn't be able to use it until i loaded it :P

i'll just submit it then, we can always change stuff later
? DATE: 2/27/2023, 12:33:25?PM

i've finished pretty much everything except scene management, and i'm debating whether we even put a title screen in. thoughts?

? DATE: 2/26/2023, 2:31:20?PM
Finally got it working after about 5 hours of debugging. Turns out you can't reference something before you actually define it, who knew? :P

As you probably know, we're within the final 48 hours. I still need someone to tackle *making scenes like a menu or an instructions page*, general juicing of the game, like particles when you break a block, and *rigging of the player*. I'm finishing block placing by tonight, and that'll be the basic game flow. I need to add an inventory and we'll be good.

Thanks for your work on this everyone, I appreciate it. We need to get top points on this because I'm not sure how the other group's entry is going to turn out at this point :P

? DATE: 2/25/2023, 6:55:33?PM
fixed. it was an odd "feature" regarding the use of var instead of let or const.

i'm working on camera constraints and block placing. once i'm done with that, it's the player rigging and scene management.

i've just been informed that i have some conflicts tomorrow that will limit my time working on this. if one of you could tackle player rigging or scene management, i would be super grateful. should be back on by monday morning to finish block placing and clean.

? DATE: 2/25/2023, 10:52:46?AM
Block breaking is done. next up is block placing.

I'm going to try to get a peaceful version working by Sunday night so I have all the time possible to think about adding mobs.

@YB keep working on generation, I'm ready to implement it as soon as you finish :)

Can anyone think about other ways to improve this? Currently the only thing about mobs I need to be handled is damage, like hitting them and they take damage.

any chance you can attempt a simple AI or is that above your paygrade? it would just need to follow the same physics as the player, spawn in randomly, and approach the player if it's close enough.

@YB
If you can, I'd like you to take full lead on generation for now. I'll be a bit busy over the next couple of days getting the bare bones of the engine scrapped together so I need you to be thinking and maybe even attempting to implement the generation.

@Akbaba
yeah actually i was wondering if you could make some modifications to the engine - mainly the fact that the physics currently require the player to have the same width and height, which, as demonstrated by the player hitboxes niko made, is not going to be the case. 

could you work it out so that it works with the player width and height being different numbers? thanks :)
? DATE: 2/21/2023, 3:23:31?PM
Right. About drawing the sprites, I was gonna cache them all at the beginning and assign a special character to each type. This character is how we would represent them in the chunk (a string of characters is one row of the chunk, which is an array of said rows).

Sounds good about the block objects, and though messy, it looks like really the only way we can do it. Just say if the sprite's position is less than so and so away then we'll make it into a block - else we remove it as a block if it is one.

That's what I was thinking, that we only loop through (and draw blocks of) chunks that are visible. Maybe every time the use switches a chunk, every block in the chunk is converted to a block. That might be the best way to switch, but we'd have to kinda cut down on the chunk size to be efficient.

On the bright side, that would mean there were only as many block objects in existence at one time as the size of a chunk.

? DATE: 2/20/2023, 2:55:39?PM
So you're saying store objects instead of instances? That seems like it would be faster, though it might shoot organization in the foot.
? DATE: 2/20/2023, 2:43:42?PM
glad it's gonna be a feature tho.
next time i'll just file an issue so you can figure it out yourself >:D
? DATE: 2/20/2023, 2:41:01?PM
yeah, i was thinking that you spawn with like 5 on each side and when you go beyond that more are spawned. not sure how that would work when we draw them though.

did you have any different ideas on any part of that? if not, we can start thinking about how to implement.
? DATE: 2/20/2023, 2:36:15?PM
hello!

let's jump right in - here's my idea that i've been mulling over for a bit.
 - the world is generated in chunks (first i was thinking 16 by 256, but now i'm thinking 30 by 200 or something).
 - each chunk is stored as an array of strings inside another array (the world array).
```
// chunk of 10 by 5
[
  '1111111111',
  '1111111111',
  '1111111111',
  '1111111111',
  '1111111111'
]
```
 - when we loop through bricks, we only loop through the currently inhabited chunk to minimize lag.
 - we edit chunks and save them in the world array when blocks are destroyed or added
 - basically, all data is stored in the world array but only a chunk is processed at a time, so we can handle huge amounts of chunks on either side (giving the illusion of infinite world generation?)
? DATE: 2/20/2023, 2:27:35?PM
hey!
i actually would like you to hop into the other thread as well so we can chat about the finer points of generation without spamming the rest of the gang.
? DATE: 2/20/2023, 2:08:44?PM
'afternoon, everyone!

Here's what the next seven days are looking like. After this post, I'd appreciate it it everyone moved to the new thread I'm making. It'll be easier to scroll through comments (which is getting annoying :/).

Monday (2/20): @Akbaba finishes physics engine
Tuesday (2/21): @NIKO finishes sprites; @DR and @YB begin generation
Wednesday (2/22): Sprites are added to the physics engine (@Akbaba?), CODE IS CLEANED AND OPTIMIZED
Thursday (2/23): Hopefully generation is finished (fingers crossed)
Friday (2/24): Last day for vitals, scene management(@DR? @YB?)
Saturday (2/25): Juicing and cleaning
Sunday (2/26): Juicing and cleaning
Monday (2/27): @DR submits finished product by 1159 PM EST

Here's a list of stuff that needs to get done if you feel like picking up an empty task:
 - image loading with @NIKO's graphics
 - incorporating akbaba's physics into a starter program [DR]
 - *BLOCK BREAKING*. Crucial.
 - scene management
 - generation [DR + YB]
 - add sprites to program
 - maybe AI? back burner, probs not gonna get it done.

If you all could chime in with things you could do in the new thread, it would be great. If y'all could, I'd appreciate it if you could check into KA at least two times a day and spend at least 10 minutes a day even cleaning code. I really, really don't want to let this sit and then have to grind on the weekend. I can't. We need to have a largely finished program by Saturday.

@Akbaba
everyone but Mojo and Fer Fer was inactive and unable to continue, so they just disbanded and their members went to other teams.

@NIKO fantastic. they're looking insane.
? DATE: 2/18/2023, 11:37:13?AM
@NIKO
you're free to go if you like, but astro said that he'd like all of us to work on this. your choice whether to stay or not, but we were allowed a seventh member who at this point is Yokie.

? DATE: 2/17/2023, 2:36:58?PM
hey! glad you could make it :)

as of right now our game plan is to make a minecraft-like editable platformer that's themed somewhere in space.

i've got nico on graphics, and akbaba's making the platformer physics.

the main tasks left then would be procedural world generation and actually editing the terrain. not sure if akbaba's gonna add in the editing, so if he doesn't i would ask you to do it.

otherwise we're solid. i'd welcome any help on world generation that you could offer come monday when i start doing it.
? DATE: 2/17/2023, 1:15:18?PM
Em will always be the one that could spit it the fastest, and he's one of the better ones. But Logic and NF especially are the future of rap, and the fact that NF can do it all and not swear every second word makes him that much more admirable than Bobby in my opinion :P
? DATE: 2/17/2023, 10:23:06?AM
also a player skin
? DATE: 2/17/2023, 10:22:36?AM
ok, just wanted to know. this is what i have to plan the game around, so i just wondered what you were planning on

ore would be great. idk if that's stone or not, but it looks nice. other than that, idk. i don't think we'll be doing a lot with light, so don't worry about torches and stuff.

if you could also make a cracking thing (like crack lines going from a little to almost all) that would be great as well because we could superimpose it over the brick when it's being mined
? DATE: 2/17/2023, 8:21:56?AM
That's interesting! Thanks for explaining, I need to test that out sometime :O
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 8:53:25?PM
literally my sibs would confirm that i was screaming. i was bout to put the NF mix on shuffle and then i saw that it had a new picture and i was like "no way bro" XD
yeah, the past selves hit me so hard for some reason lol
the best thing imo is that he no longer has to paint the smile on, which means a lot tbh

yep ?
they've got all the track names up at genius lyrics, all thirteen of em :D
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 8:26:08?PM
that's awesome xD

it was insane. like insane. he's wearing white. NF wearing white? he's pushing away his old self instead of fear. what i love is that he finally forgave his mom (if you remember back to _How Could You Leave Us_ he said he wanted to but he couldn't. now he did.)

in no way. counting the days to april 7th!
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 8:10:09?PM
literally am listening to the track for like the twentieth time, it's fire.

so excited he's getting less sad finally. i feel like this is gonna be a big turning point for him.

not mine it's just gas and i love nf so yeah :D

also guys collab coming in like a week and a half and it's gonna be super epic so definitely get ready for that!
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 6:19:21?PM
i'll handle generation. if you could finish the basic platformer engine within the next three days or so so i can start work on generation by monday, it would be appreciated.

just make it a basic block-based platformer with a manually drawn bitmap (like any normal platformer). what would also be great would be to figure out editable terrain, but we can always do that later. just have the basic physics worked out by monday :)
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 3:32:47?PM
you're good!

we're making a minecraft-like game (so a platformer with editable terrain and a procedurally generated map).

you and i will be making the mechanics. so far i can split it into physics and map generation, so if you're in any way able to create a basic platformer engine it would be appreciated. you can dm me if you need more details
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 12:57:50?PM
sounds good. we could like make it space-themed or something, like MarsCraft
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 11:22:20?AM
sure!
i honestly hadn't given that much thought on it. either would be fine, but it would be more of a recreation if we did pixel.

do whatever you're more comfortable with. if we have trashy pixel art because you aren't familiar with it, i'd rather have vertex.
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 11:12:07?AM
other big-brain idea: we make 2D minecraft but the art is different and we call it something cooler
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 10:14:02?AM
i'll wait to see if akbaba's got any ideas.

right now the only idea that i'm playing with is a game like yorg . io, don't know if any of you have ever heard of it :P
it's not an idle game but it has idle properties to it like upgrading and building a "zombie-defense empire".

dang :/
that won't work then, so we'll just stay here.

got you, good luck with that :)
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 9:41:10?AM
it's better than calling `get()` three times. it's already a slow operation, calling it three times isn't necessary if you're instead storing it and then just calling the _stored value_, not the _function_.
? DATE: 2/16/2023, 9:34:57?AM
alright so i think we need to figure this out today

so far we're thinking like idle game? i think astro's group is making something original, so it might be fun for us to do a recreation of something.

also, can we agree on another place to chat or is this is best place?
idk if y'all have discy, but if you do you can dm me jD2R#3823 (lol rip i forgot the # ?)

thanks lol it's very minimalistic
? DATE: 2/15/2023, 7:13:53?PM

? DATE: 2/15/2023, 6:58:22?PM
ok thanks :)
i'll try to make something, kinda busy with coc so no guarantees but i'll make an effort :P
? DATE: 2/15/2023, 6:29:18?PM
Can you direct me to your program? It should have worked, it might just be another error.
? DATE: 2/15/2023, 10:10:26?AM
hey! our little gang is actually super stacked haha

"A video game whose gameplay consists of the player and/or the computer itself performing simple actions (such as clicking on the screen ) repeatedly in order to progress, usually with additional elements to increase the rate of progress." says a dictionary.

so like a game where there's not a huge amount of pressure to do stuff, like a clicker.

an example would be an idle mining game where there's a guy who is continually mining and you can upgrade his speed or add more guys or upgrade an elevator or whatever.

another type of that kinda thing is like an idle farming game, where you buy seeds, farm and harvest, and then sell the crops.

they're like tycoon games, try to get the most points possible so you can brag about your score.
? DATE: 2/14/2023, 8:27:34?PM
lol how about "shot in the dark"
as an idea to change, maybe to prevent so much lag you could only draw the enemies and blocks if they're a certain distance from the player? it would be a simple distance check in the loop in the draw function.
? DATE: 2/14/2023, 8:12:33?PM

? DATE: 2/14/2023, 12:54:58?PM

that you are.

not right now. we could do the theme but it's optional, so i'm debating whether we should even try to do it at this point.
? DATE: 2/14/2023, 12:53:27?PM

eyy, nice call! thanks for the clarification on how to fix it :)
? DATE: 2/10/2023, 3:53:09?PM
You're fine, my fault for not understanding.

That code won't work, because animal is the iterator and not the array. You would have to call it like `tickle[animal]`.

Is that what you mean by the order? The variable you initialize in the loop is the one that goes _inside_ the brackets, and the array that you're checking for the length is the variable that the brackets are connected to.

Sorry if I'm not understanding lol, I'm not fully getting your wording.

? DATE: 2/8/2023, 9:46:40?AM
alright. so to be clear, i'm making:
 - bullets (coming from the mouse for now and going to the player, not coming from the player and going to the mouse)? this is so that we can test what enemy bullets will look like?
 - blocks w/ player and bullet collision
? DATE: 2/7/2023, 6:09:04?PM
maybe :D

just anywhere, i prefer at the top of the program. so right before or after`noStroke()` would be fine.

at this point, the plan is to make an fps. but an original, different fps than the one he's going to make.

it is a rather easy game, come to think of it :P

i'll keep it in mind for future programs. this one has had too many scores submitted and to redo the scoring procedure would be ineffective and annoying for both the scorers and myself at this point.

dang, probably true. though if i was on your team i woulda been kicked by now for having made no progress on my entry, so kinda happy about that xD

why is it curious, though? it's a fact that reputation gets you further than skill every time, and i'll happily disagree with anyone who says otherwise.
if that's true, then what's unexpected about something like this, which has a huge meme following, surpassing programs of more skill? checks out to me, and it's the way the community's been for a while. no surprise there.

that doesn't mean i'm for it. explanations are not supporting statements. heck, this is a pretty awful program in terms of code.

i think the lesson we're all learning from this is that a few rectangles in the right places mean more than they look like - especially to immature kids that are obsessed with the meaning (and who account for many of the votes).

ok cool, you making an intro too? I seem to remember that you said you were.

idea numero uno
top-down scroller, fill enemies with blobs that you shoot and once they are full, they turn into blobs that you eat to get more blobs to shoot, etc.

idea numero dos
push puzzle, like sokoban type game. more likely gonna do this one, i just have to make it super amazing to stand out.

great ideas, right?
so genius much wow

ski said that it's a great deal slower than using `nf.constructor` or `sq.constructor`.

`eval()` is pretty much just a workaround for `new Function()`. If you find yourself using it, you should replace it with one of the options I listed above.

ignore this
vvvvvvvvv

? DATE: 1/17/2023, 6:20:20?PM
You know about reverse iteration? Of course you do!
You know what annoys me about it? It doesn't look neat, duh.
You know what I did? Made a beautiful function, what else?
```
Array.prototype.reverseLoop = function(callback) {
    for (var i = this.length; i--;) {
        callback.call(this, this[i]);
    }
};
```
Turns out that you can define methods for a particular type, such as the `Array` type, or even a `String` or `Number`. Here's another example with a string type.
```
String.prototype.reverse = function() {
   return this.split('').reverse().join();
};
```
It's pretty neat to be able to do this, but keep in mind that you shouldn't need to do it that often. Adding methods to built-in types is *never* preferred to adding methods on your own objects and classes.

Also, for anyone who is concerned about me using `callback.call()` instead of just calling `callback()` - it's an opinion. Show me it runs faster your way and I'll change it.
? DATE: 1/17/2023, 5:08:50?PM

? DATE: 1/17/2023, 4:39:10?PM
idk about that. Ace did a bad job last year imo, and so did Cyberwolf. Not to mention IA getting banoozled.
but yeah, in the end it comes down to three things.
1) who's staying active.
2) who's got technical skill.
3) who can take that skill and translate it into programs.
if the captain drafts on these principles, he's set.
? DATE: 1/17/2023, 4:14:29?PM

probably, but you've made some decent content. Astro's right (nice subtle praise of yourself there, sir), all of the captains are really talented this year. 

hopefully they're as good at leading as they are at writing code - two very different things.

Polar, I have quick question for you.

lol why are you drafting like this? why don't you just follow the directives to give 12 people you want? why is your team 'open to all'? do you understand how CoC works?

i can't tell if you're losing your mind or if you're just acting dumb for some reason :P
? DATE: 1/13/2023, 5:19:27?PM

i'm sure he knows what he's doing. truthfully, i'd rather be working with him but if my absence leaves a spot open for you, i'm all for it :D

yo excited for Embers, dude! can't wait till that comes out now.
i'd rather we wait for prima or somethin' like that lol if that's alright with you.
decent? the girl is online 24/7.

only because i've gotten 100+ votes in the past two-ish weeks. you gotta play it with the recents, if you make more recent stuff more people'll know you. guaranteed if i didn't make 16 things or the ignes homepage i would not be #4.
i would be too lol, i was last year when kevin only picked me as his like 26th option :P
yeah, it's still a way off. we'll think when we get there :D
? DATE: 1/12/2023, 7:20:41?PM
yeah you got the secret weapon xD
yes sKI lol

well at least he wants you
cowboy's actually a bit mad at him for picking a bunch of no names instead of well-established KA devs. personally i think it's a smart move on his part :P

i'm going to be honest with you - the only real advantage i have is time and activity. you have a ton of skill and i'm not sure why people are ignoring it :P
like you've put some stuff that's much better than i have. i've finished like 2 games, and they've both been pretty bad lol.
and no, if you make some cool stuff in CoC, Prima and TCO you're gonna be head and shoulders above the competition. i mean come on they asked paperwad lol you could be better than him if you tried really hard.
? DATE: 1/12/2023, 6:44:03?PM
you're good. i'm planning to rewrite basically the whole thing so i think you're ok for now. i might run the second draft by you if you don't mind when i finish - just to get a second set of eyes :D
? DATE: 1/12/2023, 6:41:46?PM
yay! gl to you guys, you probably got the win xD
not if we work hard though >:)
team astro ftw

yes we must :D
we must build up our reputation and social credit so we can both be captains next year!

? DATE: 1/10/2023, 9:44:13?AM
i actually don't agree with that, i think imagine is the proper case for the context he's using it in.

just my take, might be wrong.
? DATE: 1/9/2023, 8:52:51?PM
yeah honestly i wouldn't be unhappy with paperwad if none of the other captains had any interest. keep your eyes peeled on the captain's thread, that's where they'll post their wish list for people. i remember back to the day i was 12th on Kevin W.'s list and i was so proud xD

yep yep yep
fine, they do have a cool avatar lol
? DATE: 1/9/2023, 8:16:52?PM
if i was a gamblin' man i would bet lots of money that he's first pick, followed by JS and maybe virtuosa.
if you don't get drafted i doubt i will :(

ooh neat
don't bother learning sql on ka. go learn the rough basics off-KA, then apply your knowledge to a more modern technology like mongodb or firebase.
yEs aLL fOR thE SubBerS
yes activity is very necessary. if we're not on the same team here (we probably won't), let's go together for primavera.
? DATE: 1/9/2023, 8:00:36?PM
honestly i'm out of ideas and motivation. hopefully i'll figure something out for the first round of coc (assuming i get drafted, maybe not :O).

my goals for this year are to one-up on my web design, though.
 - learn react
 - learn next.js
 - become css master
 - fully master js (learn asynchronous stuff)
 - tailwindcss
 - start using linux on my home machine
 - learn git command line
 - make more KA programs to satisfy the program-hungry subbers

you make any goals for the year in terms of programming?

we are, there are just some things about who he is that bother me. i'm sure he has even more things about me that he dislikes. doesn't mean i dislike him totally, just some things he does :D

pOInt GraNTEd
it's good until it's not. he doesn't get nearly as much stuff out as other people. however, when he gets something out, you can tell he's spent some time on it. i guess it comes down to quality vs. quantity.
i'm sure it's amazingly fantastic. never done it though xD
the issue with that is that he worries about micro-optimizations that don't really matter. if it works one way and you want to switch one method that doesn't really even make much of a difference, why say anything?

i actually don't have a whole lot more. i'll say he's polarizing and leave it at that, which isn't necessarily a bad thing depending on how you think about it.

`https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/6220028490858496`

2. How much can you be active?
I'm planning to be pretty active for this (say 3-6 hours a day). I'm doing another comp during the season, but I'll try to devote more of my time towards this.

3. Anything else we should consider?
I've not been here super long, but I feel like I've accomplished a lot. I also did CoC last year as ski's replacement for Team Neutrons if that means anything lol
Expect webpages, game design with PJS/Canvas and logic. Graphics aren't my forte, but I can make some pretty good lookin' ones in a pinch.

? DATE: 1/8/2023, 8:41:25?PM
uh, what ways, o.o?

1. work very very hard.
2. add and style components one at a time.
3. build on your design as you go.
4. look up how to do literally everything.
5. don't reinvent the wheel. use things you already have.

do this and you shall become great.

@Corin
is the reverse iteration really just a KA bug? the concept seems like it would have an effect on other platforms. it's literally just an issue with the looping and how it'll skip elements when you splice from the front back instead of the back front.

are you stalking or do you have something rigged to alert you any time the word polar is used in the KACP lol

it said it sent the comment in the extension but when i went on to check, it wasn't there. it's happened probably about 5-8 times at this point :P
still a fAntAsTIc extension if i do say so myself
? DATE: 1/6/2023, 12:56:38?PM
Semicolons, if you please.
6. Oh, ok.
9. Who reads documentation anyway? (i do lol) You're right though, maybe I should just link the page.
10. well ofc it's preference. i'm just stating that i'd personally rather not read a file that have 20000 lines, 10000 of which are blank space. might be taking it a bit far, but idrc.
12. right. walls of text are intimidating. Maybe I can find some way to share little tips that aren't in walls of text...
13. true and true.

because i only agree with one point of view - mine. mine could change, but if it's not in my mindset then i'm generally not for it.
plus, wild commenters give me something to do all day lol
? DATE: 1/6/2023, 12:51:01?PM
You've got a point. If that works for you in this circumstance, do it.
? DATE: 1/6/2023, 12:24:07?PM
Your preference. Not saying it's better than mine, but it's good to go with what you know and can work with.
Ok, make a special case for KA then. When you're writing code with other editors, especially if you're porting it to open-source, stick to 1 line at the end.
Correct - it's preference. But you can do so much more than just call the two functions. It's kind of an administrator role for the object - everything gets done there.
What about readability? I don't know that WASD is 87 65 83 68, how am I supposed to understand your code?

thanks :D
? DATE: 1/5/2023, 10:06:42?AM
mhmm. sure, sure.

yep, readability should be the second thing programmers think of besides getting the job done. if i'm asked to organize a bookshelf and i do it but in my special way instead of the conventional method, i won't be respected and probably won't be asked to do it again.
it should be something that everyone wants, so i feel that no disclaimer is necessary.
oh yes, this was meant to be a scathing rant. granted, the information was subtly flawed at places but overall i feel like my message was received whether it was with good feelings or not.
i'll be the first to admit that the small text is more because i wasn't motivated enough to update the page. at the most basic level it was to save my scalp from the wild commentors in chat.
good point. i'll attempt to be more concise in the future.

allow me to point out that my intentions were not flawed, my execution was. the way i chose to fix some of the mistakes i made was in no way the best approach style-wise.
you're absolutely right about the contributors list, i felt like it was taking up a bit too much room myself.
yes please. i didn't run this through any kind of editing so i appreciate the attention given to fixing little mistakes :D

1. ok, i'll look into it!
2. it's necessary until i'm told it's not simply because of the peace of mind. it's literally one line - what's difficult about that? apparently it _is_ too much to ask of the community, >:(. what's your point about the JAVA2D? that you can write that instead?
3. thanks and thanks. not sure what you mean about the comments, and to the point about the objects, it's convention. run your code through any beautifier and it'll do it for you.
6. restate, please. are you saying that i should add info about the throwing errors with `throw`?
9. why don't people know how to do it, then? is the KA explanation not working? personally, no one wants to go watch an instruction video that's 10 minutes long when you can read what i've written in 30 seconds and then do your own research for 5 minutes and probably understand it better.
10. so you're saying i'm wrong or right? minimize blank lines. blank line at the end of the file. done and done.
12. why doesn't everyone do it all the time, then? i wouldn't have written it if i didn't see it somewhere.
13. separating them into objects? arrays work for color values too, iirc.
14. correct. it's just a simple example, but if you're saying people could get tripped up i can definitely look into it.
15. right! saying something is low-quality without saying how to improve it is worse than saying good job, because at that point you've both made the dev doubt their skills _and_ left them in the dark about how to improve. "I like some of what you said" isn't good either, because it's not specific. Your feedback was perfect because it gives me things to fix right away and things to think about for later.

oh, i am. i am.
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 8:47:41?PM

? DATE: 1/4/2023, 5:49:21?PM

#1 and 5. Thanks!

About the manager: why have I literally never heard of this before? It makes a lot of sense, but I'll definitely have to do some thinking now about how to implement that kind of thing into games.
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 4:18:34?PM
If one line of code makes a difference for even one person, I'd keep it.

Pardon, but what do you mean by condense? It's a preference thing though nonetheless.

Thank you! :)
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 3:30:33?PM
Like I said in the program, there are a bunch of different use cases for each. You're saying to move first and then draw? It makes sense but I just want to be sure.

Just using it as an example lol, but in reality toads are way cooler than frogs.

Thanks! Hopefully when, it'd be great to see some new stuff from you at some point :D
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 12:08:54?PM
thanks for letting me know!
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 10:41:07?AM
Yeah, which is why it's not the best. Stay tuned for more on that though, I'm putting out version 2 of this today with better explained code.
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 9:08:28?AM
It complicates your program when it gets more complex. If you have to check for 30 keys, you suddenly have 90 lines of code in the key function instead of one or two.
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 9:07:40?AM
I agree with you mostly! As long as they're learning, I'm all for it.
Also about the comments, writing clean code should always take first preference and I'll agree with that. But comments have their place too, even if it's not on the same level.

Thanks :)
believe me, this is short compared to some of the other comments I've received xD
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 9:03:32?AM
Please read other's comments. The program is not the one solid rule in the least, many if not all of these commenters know more than I do.
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 9:02:44?AM
real slick there bro xDD
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 9:01:12?AM
judgement will come at the end of time for the unclean (un-neat ig lol)
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 8:57:24?AM
Properties are pretty simple. They're like variables that are the children of an object, so you access the values like `parent.child`. An example...

```
var player = {
   x: 0,
   y: 10,
   name: "Player 1"
};

println(player.x);    // 0
println(player.y);    // 10
println(player.name); // "Player 1"
```
It's just to stay away from having multiple variables that could all be grouped together in the same "grouping" or object. If you have 5 variables that all pertain to the player in the game, why not group them together to make it easier to read?
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 8:53:35?AM
Playing around with styles is great in a testing environment or when you're experimenting - but when you start to build more professional, finished code you need to start sticking to one style. It's what makes your code your code. Totally for switching around when you're learning though, or maybe as a personal challenge to yourself to make everything a class :D

Totally agree with the last point. Brainless execution is what we're trying to avoid here lol
? DATE: 1/4/2023, 8:49:59?AM
#1. So you would say it's alright to keep it then or should I just go the `false` route?

#5. So you're saying I should, or shouldn't? I understand there are reasons to go either way, especially when projects get more complex.

I totally get your point about the micro-optimizations. Could you elaborate on what a manager is and how to implement it though?

Thanks for your comments. I really appreciate it :)

Tradeoffs, as usual :P
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 6:22:01?PM
Thanks!

`*The Response*`
#1 - ok I'll definitely look into that :D
#2 - it's preference. I use `update()`, but `display()` works too. the reasoning behind using the word update is that update has a 'do everything' connotation. display to me seems like another word for drawing, but if you think of it a different way it's your deal.
#3 - don't know why I didn't include that. That's the correct way to do it, so not sure why I didn't put it in. I'll change it when I have time.

thanks for your comments mr. lemon
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 4:28:42?PM
'Nuff said. I know you're a busy guy xD

Nope, `// jshint esnext: true` just enables you to write `let` and `const`. The one that breaks out of the loop protector might have been the one you were referring to, but idk.

#12 appears mostly in beginner programs, you're right. As to #16, just leave it. Obviously my original intent was lost in transit to some people, and that's probably my fault. I'll look at revising the wording.

I know lol I tend to get a bit mad at mistakes people keep making :P
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 4:12:33?PM
@Polar
You don't know how much I wish KA could bring TS to the platform. It's just better because as you said, the code is more self-explanatory. This guide was aimed mainly at KA PJS users specifically, and so many things such as comments might not fit exactly how they're supposed to.
also HTML comments are hard to write so I'll grant that point

@Astro
to each his own. well I can see flaws with terribly excessive commenting, a comment every 10 lines or less can and should be written.
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 4:03:05?PM
You're welcome! Thanks for bringing these issues to my attention.

For a few reasons, the least of which is that it's storing and removing two values instead of one on every keypress. Not necessary, simply to make the job of the developer easier by providing character options. If you're referencing the `String()` or the `delete` issues, you're correct.

VXS? Because it works. In this case, I doubt the reputation poses much of an issue. Same reason I can use thumbnail.js and not get yelled at, even though the developer is also somewhat infamous.
As to the `smooth()` issue, I've been told it does something somewhere and so that's honestly better than not including it and doing nothing anywhere.

Thanks! I hoped everyone could find something useful.

About the oh-noes thing, I don't feel bad because I've made mention that it is somewhat dangerous. However, it's up to the developer as to whether or not they want to include it.
A. What's not legal about it?
B. It's not shady, it doesn't even do anything besides allow the names to be typed. It's honestly just for looks.
C. What errors?

I agree with you slightly. Good variable names are really really important, as I stated previous! However, if there comes a time when you do need to use short names for whatever reason, and there will be a time, then use comments to clarify.
Eh, I've been told there can never be too many comments. I don't agree with it, but there's a bit of truth to it. You're correct though, when the relationship is 67% comments and 33% code, you might want to reexamine.

Yep, and I don't regret it. 'Nice work' is bad feedback for the developer and I'll stand by that.

Ok, I think I worded this a bit strongly in the page. What I mean is to stop making programs that are comprised of half stack overflow and half random blog you found. In #2 I mention using code from @dkareh and @VXS. If I hated people using other people's code completely, I would have never said that. And your point about the credit is fantastic! It's always good to credit people who have taught you something! :D

It's not the hard and fast ruleset, and I'm happy people are disagreeing with some aspects because it means that you're thinking on your own, and I appreciate that. And yeah, we might always disagree on some things. That's just preference.

No prob! Keep up the good work and you'll be makin' those advanced games in no time :D
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 1:57:39?PM
Thanks! Glad you found it helpful.

#5 also mentioned that everyone's needs are different. Hopefully you can find a way to make it work for you and if not, don't include it!

Yep, there are definitely edge cases. For something like that it would be more logical to just draw a rectangle every frame. Why? Because as someone pointed out, drawing an image just means it takes all of the shapes and calls them as one shape. When you're only drawing one rectangle, you don't need to worry about imagizing it because at that point the only thing you're doing is losing quality.

```
function response(word, name) {
   println(word + ", " + name + "!");
}

response("Thanks", "Phase9");
```
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 11:09:09?AM
Yep, you can indent anywhere you want to in your code. I just do it because it makes me think about how all the stuff inside is affected by the push/pop on the outside.

A quick google search on how to comment JS code might be beneficial. In general, just describe basically what the line does. Example:
```
// returns a reversed string
return str.split('').reverse().join('');

// outputs a random number from 0 to 1 to the console
println(random());
```
It doesn't have to be terribly in-depth for in-line comments, but when writing function descriptions you might need to get a bit more descriptive.
```
/**
   * Outputs a greeting to the console
   * @param1 {String} default "Hello"
   * @param2 {String} default "World"
*/
function greet(greeting="Hello", audience="World") {
   println(greeting + ", " + audience + "!");
}
```
I haven't worked much with chains of inheritance, but if it's necessary then you can break these rules. However, always be looking for ways to refactor if you find yourself breaking too many.

Of course! Hope this explanation is helpful as well.
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 10:41:00?AM

yw! should've been more but I wanted to get this out.
and no it was very late and i was very tired o-o

yay criticism!
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 10:39:29?AM
You have some good points here yourself, sir! :D

1. nope, it's not the same. *I* thought it looked cleaner when printing arrays to have no keys instead of a bunch of falsy values, but I've gotten some pushback about that so I might have to reexamine.

8. performance > smooth graphics imho.

13. good point.

16. I'm so split on this, but in general it's a good idea to steal code and I'm glad you mentioned that. You also hit not copy-pasting, which is very correct. If someone's just taking code and using it, it might work but the programmer has gained absolutely nothing because of it. Learning from your mistakes and shortcomings is key.
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 10:32:13?AM
@Dat
It's your style, bud. But don't expect anyone to be able to maintain it but you xD

Polar also has a point. WebGL code is very very tricky to understand if you're new to what it does. Just shoot for basic readability using *excessive comments* and everything else will fall into place.
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 10:29:32?AM
thanks! thought I'd go minimal, I think it's got a nice vibe :D

1. yep! sometimes it's helpful, but a lot of the time a simple `clicked` variable'll do it better. just about measuring what, where, and why you need something.

2. for games, I'm all for image loading. large graphics, not so much.

3-7. *salutes*

8. totally, expecially when you're drawing them every frame like players or blocks in a game. the sad thing is that it's not even that hard to implement.

12. for sure.

13. yeah, it's definitely a risk - especially when you're using bad, undescriptive variable names that could easily be shadowed without a second thought >:(

14. they're kinda clunky but imho they're cleaner than a bunch of if-elses
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 10:15:04?AM

Thanks JS!

I've heard that a lot. I might need to start doing some benchmarking, it seems like it would be faster but I want proof.

I'm going with Rur on this one. It's preference, they both have the same use but in different ways. I just find it cleaner to use `switch`, but to each his own.

Yeah, it's more targeting people that basically make a hundred different globals when they could have just more easily made an object. Consider yourself above the law :)

@Rur
Object vs. Array = Readability vs. Speed
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 10:02:49?AM
Ok, I'll look into that. Thanks :)
? DATE: 1/3/2023, 8:15:03?AM
Thank you! I'll do my best to address or modify the hairs lol :)

#1: Wasn't aware of that. I took PT's code which was the `toString()` and just changed it to `String()` because I wanted shorter code. Guess shorter isn't always faster.

#2: Ok, thanks for letting me know. I saw a demo about what it did and it seemed to blur the edges, but it's good to know what it does in reality to make it look that way.

#8: Also true.

#9: Explain. Can you use the API in PJS? I've never heard of that before, o.O.

Thanks for your comments!

? DATE: 2/28/2023, 4:28:17?PM
Hi Liam, I had a quick favor to ask.

ski and I are looking at hosting a short hackathon right after CoC, and I was wondering if there was any way you could ensure that it didn't cross over with Primavera - based off of the assumption that you're running it again this year.

We would only need about 2-3 weeks for this. I'm not sure of when Primavera is scheduled to start, but I think we'd both really appreciate it if you carved out these couple weeks even if it means pushing Primavera back a week or two.

Thanks for your consideration and looking forward to your response :)

I've heard there's a problem with using the `new` keyword with objects, something about them being "not properly disposed of" or something. So I want to know, why does this code work?

`Object.constructor.prototype.new = (function() {
    var obj = Object.create(this.prototype);
    this.apply(obj, arguments);
    return obj;
});

`allows you to call`

var new_object = object.new(parameters);`

? DATE: 2/3/2023, 6:41:23?PM
what you're going to want to do is 1) use proper platformer physics and 2) slow that player down a bit.

for #1, you can take a look at one of my programs for now. i'll try to make a more personalized demo for you at some point but atm this is the best thing you can look at.
https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/ice-slide-wcc/6705944713281536

as to #2, we shall delve into how side collisions work.

when a player hits a wall from the right, we want him to be pushed left until he is no longer touching the block. likewise with the left.
note that *this only works because the system checks once per frame*. if during the same frame a player is moved in and out of a block, no collision will register. hence slow the player down so there's no chance of that happening.

sorry that this isn't super in-depth. please ask if you have any more questions :)

hmmm...
overvoted but somewhat true.

my tips on how to grow your network?
1) talk to people. every comment is a link to your profile page ?
2) that being said, comment literally everywhere so people can see you're here and what you're like.
3) actually make some good stuff. when i see someone talking around, i'll look at their programs. if the stuff you make is trash, i don't really care about who you are or what you do because you're not going to provide any insight to me.

ik it might sound harsh, but if you don't add to my value, i'm not likely to like you as a coder. you'll just be that one annoying little "fan" that i can't get rid of.

Hi Chase!

This is looking fantastic so far :)

Make sure to use reverse iteration when you're looping through the pipes. You might notice that currently there's a blinking effect going on when a pipe is removed. Change your iteration method on line 332 to fix it.
```
for (var i = pipes.length; i--;) {
```

? DATE: 1/24/2023, 2:54:13?PM
It looks okay so far. I'm going to give you a little tip about how you detect when the key is pressed - you're not doing it the right way. Try this:
```
var keys = {};
keyPressed = function() {
    keys[keyCode] = true;
};
keyReleased = function() {
    keys[keyCode] = false;
};
```
I know it looks confusing. I'm not even going to explain it right now, just copy and paste it at the top of your program.

Now, instead of calling `if (keyIsPressed && keyCode === UP)`, you can just call `if (keys[UP])`!

Here's code that moves the player left and right. You can try switching the keys to different keys like `UP` and `DOWN` if you like :)
```
var a=1;

var keys = {};
keyPressed = function() {
    keys[keyCode] = true;
};
keyReleased = function() {
    keys[keyCode] = false;
};

draw= function() {
    background(255, 255, 255);
    if (keys[RIGHT]) {
        // same thing as a = a+1 or a+=1
        a++;
    }
    if (keys[LEFT]) {
        // same thing as a = a-1 or a-=1
        a--;
    }
    // player
    fill(255, 0, 255);
    rect(a,308,12,12);
    // ground
    fill(171, 17, 17);
    rect(0,320,407,81);
};
fill(255, 0, 255);
rect(0,308,12,12);
fill(171, 17, 17);
rect(0,320,407,81);
```

well. joke's on the people who only got 8, because by harnessing the power of a line of code that *I specifically mentioned in 16 Things*, I got to 11 and could have gotten further had I not become bored with waiting.

```
(function() {return this;})().LoopProtector.prototype.leave = function() {};
```

It crashes because the loop protector goes nuts after it waits for long enough. Removing loop protection removes crashes :)

Props, fractals suck to make. They're fun to look at, though! :D

Nicely done! Had a lot of fun playing this :)

One thing I would suggest improving for future games would be to implement reverse iteration. If you notice during the boss fight, sometimes the lava will blink as it comes at you. This is because you're iterating through the loop the normal way instead of reverse.

hey Cardstock! :D
your code makes me sad. it's too complicated haha, do this instead:

```
var pluscreativity = new button(300, 140, 40, "+", function () {
    Creativity = constrain(Creativity + 1, 0, 10);
});
var minuscreativity = new button(100, 140, 40, "-", function () {
    Creativity = constrain(Creativity - 1, 0, 10);
});
```
or just add and subtract in the functions and constrain the values when the mouse is clicked or something, I understand the above could be considered a bit overkill :P

Maybe replace the printing to the console with some text instead? When I comment out line 442 it runs about 10 frames faster, and I think replacing that with text wouldn't lag nearly as much.

ever wonder why both of you got banned? seems pretty obvious to me (spam, *off-topic conversation*).

KA isn't the place for that. the people who are here are here to code, not to be involved in an emotional support center :P
not a bad thing, it's just that the guardians aren't very forgiving when it comes to off-topic convos and spam.

and this program is possibly making it worse. don't ask for spinoffs, it's against the guidelines.

? DATE: 9/19/2022, 10:11:28?AM
Nice concept. A step above the classic dodge game, so I commend you for that.

Some things to maybe improve...
 - Make the background move like a parallax so it looks like you're actually going somewhere.
 - Maybe put some more work into the graphics like the tunnel.
 - Try to cut back on lag by image-izing some normal things, like the rocks or the player.
 - Make a loading system, and don't just make me sit here and watch the computer crash as it tries to load the 3 images you do have. This is something you do for all of your games/graphics, and it gets kind of annoying that you can't implement a system that would fix a bunch of problems for the future. I _highly_ recommend you look into adding one to your future games. (https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/4894256982441984)

Overall it's not bad. Looking forward to Avatar War :D

looking great! tip: check out a game on Scratch called Zombies by theChAOTiC. it's a fantastic top-down shooter in this kind of style.

since it's a simpler concept though, I would be sure to add tons of skins, guns, and achievements to keep the player grinding to collect them all.

? DATE: 6/15/2022, 8:24:54?AM
Nice particles! I love the little effects, like the planets.
I know it was a speed round, but here are some things I'd like to see next time:
 - parallax effect with the stars and planets
 - smooth movement (maybe changing a velocity when the key is pressed, and changing the x by that velocity?)
 - maybe some text in the program that says how to control it?
 - and move everything out of the `draw` loop, it's a bit crammed. maybe use OOP for the stars, planets, and rocket? it's a bit overboard, but it would've gotten you more points for sure.

Overall, fantastic work! So psyched to see your next entry to the comp!
? DATE: 6/14/2022, 6:01:15?PM

? DATE: 6/14/2022, 10:10:05?AM
Hands down the best game I've seen all Primavera. Why?

- The graphics are incredible and really fit the mood.
- The platforming itself is so polished, and I love the wall jumping.
- You did it in canvas. Crazy stuff.
- The juicing is really awesome.
- The lights are raytraced, and that's fantastic.

However, I've got a few suggestions/observations.
- More particles spawn on the walls than on the floor. IDK if this was intentional lol
- My brother said it would be cooler if you could squish enemies lol
- The text is a bit loud. Maybe tone it down a bit in the how tab?
- Maybe introduce abilities of the player in-game instead of making them visit the how to know how to do things like walljumping? And make a way for the player to discover things like the lights without dying.

As I said, fantastic game. Y'all should be super proud of what you accomplished :)

Is the workaround for Google Fonts allowed in the PJS environment? I didn't think so, but I might be wrong.
? DATE: 5/17/2022, 6:11:02?PM
Change line 296 to this to get rid of the spacing between blocks:

`ctx.translate((-player.x + width/2) | 0, (-player.y + height/4) | 0);`

The `| 0` simply truncates the decimal which causes the spacing, you could also use `floor()` or `~~`.

wow, clean code from a graphics maker.

_`*respect*`_
? DATE: 4/22/2022, 2:14:57?PM
You could simplify this greatly by taking advantage of one of PJS's predefined functions.

`noStroke();

mouseDragged = function() {
    fill(random(0,255),random(0,255),random(0,255));
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20);
};`

So whenever the mouse is dragged, it generates a new color and draws a new ellipse. No draw function needed! :D
? DATE: 4/22/2022, 10:06:27?AM

Wow Andrew, this is incredible! The gameplay is excellent, I love how the jumping and the choos work :D

If I had to suggest one thing, it would be new graphics. I realize that this is an old wip, but you could definitely make some new graphics that are more simplistic and fit the theme better.

Again, this is really awesome! More judging feedback to come from myself and the judges after the deadline. :)

fascinating.

So Winston being a "stop sign ahead" sign is maybe because everyone, in his or her coding journey will reach a point where they hit a mental "stop sign".
And you saying "go have a snack". It's clearly because having a snack is one of the cures of this mental block (I find that a nice bag of Takis is the perfect thing to "set your mind alight", one might say.)

So now we get down to the math. Four points on the sign, one Winston. What's four minus one? *Three*. And we know what three means, don't we? :)

_wink wink nod nod_

Do you have code you could show me?

That's a problem sometimes. It all depends on how you check collisions. My method (and probably a method used by a ton of others as well) requires two separate loops to go through the blocks - one to check player y collisions, and one to check player x collisions.

In each loop, you'll check for a rectRect collision between the player and the block, and then if there is one, you'll do the following.

Y COLLISION:
```
this.yv = 0;
this.canJump = b.y < this.y ? false : true;
this.y = this.y < b.y ? b.y - this.h : b.y + b.h;
```

you might be wondering what the ? and : are about. it's called a ternary operator, and it's basically an if-else statement in one line.
```
condition ? if true : if false
```

X COLLISION:
```
this.x = this.x < b.x ? b.x - this.w - 0.1 : b.x + b.w + 0.1;
```

Change the velocities and stuff in between the loops (yv after y loop, xv after x loop).

Hopefully that makes a bit of sense.

You can use the keyword `var` to declare variables in the PJS editor, as I'm sure you're aware of.

That line just allows you to use the other two keywords that are available with regular JS, namely `let` and `const`.

Unlike regular JS though, they don't actually have any effect on the code. KA just goes through and replaces every `let` and `const` with `var` in the final code.

TLDR; it's just a way that you can use `let` and `const` to declare variables instead of `var`.
If you delete the line, you'll notice that errors will be thrown wherever there is a `let` or `const` because PJS won't know what they mean.

Good day to you as well! :D

Iterating through an array with a for loop is easy. First you're going to want to set up a loop to traverse the array.

```
var testArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
for (var i = 0; i < testArray.length; i++) {
  // ...
}
```
Inside of the loop, accessing the elements is as simple as calling the element at the position of the iterator (`testArray[i]`).

```
var testArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
for (var i = 0; i < testArray.length; i++) {
  println(testArray[i]);
}
```
This program will output the following in the console.

```
a
b
c
d
e
```
Now, does the variable have to be named `i`? By no means. This works as well.

```
var testArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];
for (var foo = 0; foo < testArray.length; foo++) {
  println(testArray[foo]);
}
```
And that's about it. Be sure to ask if you don't understand! :D

Complicated.

Short answer? Have it always be shown on top of the page and toggle the width from x to 0 (where x is how wide you want it to be) when the associated button is pressed.

Long answer? Look in the third style tag and the first script tag and try to piece a picture together. I'm happy to clarify anything in the code, but I can't give you a long answer at the moment.

Here's a simple example. Scrub the numbers around a bit and explore what you can do with just these couple functions.

```
rect(100, 100, 200, 100);

pushMatrix();
rotate(30);
translate(80, 10);
rect(100, 100, 200, 100);
popMatrix();
```
? DATE: 12/14/2022, 3:44:39?PM
You get 95% of the sticks. In this case I believe it's a *score of 38 or above*.
? DATE: 12/14/2022, 3:41:12?PM
Changing the line color is as simple as `stroke(r, g, b)`.

```
stroke(255, 0, 0);
strokeWeight(2);
ellipse(width/2, height/2, 200, 200);
```

As to rotation, you can use `rotate()`. You probably won't understand all of the technicalities for a bit, but it's a quick fix. It helps to put `pushMatrix()` and `popMatrix()` around whatever you're rotating so everything else on the screen doesn't rotate too ;)

Another note - using `translate(x, y)` gives you more mobility as to how and where to move the rectangle after you rotate it. Why not stick that in there as well?

```
rect(100, 100, 200, 100);

pushMatrix();
rotate(30);
translate(80, 10);
rect(100, 100, 200, 100);
popMatrix();
```

Hope this helps. Don't hesitate to ask if you don't understand.

Great question! Call the function `noLoop()` inside of the draw loop. This'll stop it from looping. To start it again, call `loop()`.

Rounded rectangles can be made using the normal rect() function but with added parameters. So if you include x, y, w, h, and the last one which rounds the corners.

Now here's the part that most people don't know - rect() actually has not four, not five, but *eight* parameters. The four corners of the rectangle all have an _individual_ corner-rounding parameter. Pretty neat, right?

`rect(200, 200, 200, 200, 0, 100, 50, 10);`
? DATE: 10/7/2022, 11:53:37?AM
It depends on what you want to do. If you want a new random number to be generated by the program automatically without you needing to hit the restart button, you need a draw loop.

`draw = function() {
   println(random(0, 10)); // prints a random number from 0 to 10 every frame
};`

But to have a program that prints a random number every time you hit the restart button, no draw loop is required.

`println(random(0, 10)); // prints a random number from 0 to 10 every time the program is restarted`
? DATE: 10/4/2022, 12:59:09?PM
I use the characters on line 22.

Note how they go from bigger to smaller characters. This is so that it looks like the brightness is different.

Lastly, the loop on line 45 actually draws out the text.

A parameter is a way to get user information into a function in a way that alters how the function is run. Take this unit conversion function, for example. The value it returns changes with how many feet we want to convert.

`var feetToInches = function(feet) {
   var inches = feet * 12;
   println("There are " + inches + " inches in " + feet + " feet.");
};

feetToInches(4); // "There are 48 inches in 4 feet.`

There are a couple ways to do it, but the one that most accurately does what you want is accomplished by changing the `frameCount()` to something like 30. Just don't set it to 0, which is like setting it to as fast as it'll go.

Also note this will slow all objects down, because it's literally changing the frameCount (how many frames are drawn in a second).

I'm positive that someone will answer in more CS-related terms, but I'll give you a plain-English rundown.

`return` is like when the function gives something back to you. Take this for example. Below I have two functions. One prints something, the other returns something that we will print.

`function add(a, b) {
    println(a + b);
}`
`function add2(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}`

Now watch this.

`
add(1, 2); // prints 3
println(add2(1, 2)); // prints 3 
`

To put it simply, return just returns whatever it's given to return in a function, and then you can do things with it like this.

println(add2(add2(1, 2) + add(4 + 2))); // basically (1 + 2) + (4 + 2)

Hope this helps a bit. Please don't hesitate to ask if you don't understand something, this and parameters were the hardest things for me to grasp when dealing with functions.

The *break* statement terminates a loop.

`while (i < 6) {
   if (i === 3) {
      break;
   }
   i = i + 1;
}

println(i) // outputs 3.`

The *switch* statement is a simplified if-else chain.

`var scene = "play";
switch (scene) {
   case ("play"):
      println("The video is playing.");
      break; // breaking out of the statement when we're done.
   case ("pause"):
      println("The video is paused".);
      break; // more on this later.
}`

The above code will print "The video is playing".
As to the last break statement, it's not required. The last break statement in a switch statement is optional, but it's good to put it there anyway.

Arrays are containers of data. They're like a big box that can hold other boxes, but in the computer programming world they're really powerful because they can hold huge amounts of data in many data types.

[ ] <-- square brackets. That's what the big box is. Inside of this 'box', we can hold many things like integers (numbers), strings, or even other arrays! Let me show you what I mean with an example.

`var myArray = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];`

This is an array that holds five integers: the numbers 0 - 4. Try printing the array to the console using a println.

`println(myArray);`

Wow look, it shows you all the numbers! But that's not useful right now, we want to access the different elements of the array themselves. So we use square brackets.

println(myArray[0]);

This will print '0'. This is because arrays start at 0 and count up.

So as a recap, arrays are *containers of data*. We create them 
 and access specific elements using *square brackets*. As a last point, arrays *start from 0, not from 1*.

Hopefully this makes sense. Please don't hesistate to ask if you have any more questions.

If you have an array of strings, then you can use random() to pick a random string.

`var greetings = ["hello","hi","hey there","wassup","yo"];
var r = floor(random(0, greetings.length + 1)); // returns a number from 0 to 5
println(greetings[r]); // prints one of the greetings

Does that make sense? Please let me know.`
? DATE: 5/6/2022, 9:35:29?AM
floor(random(0,5)) actually does give 5 possible outcomes - 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. random() might return the bottom number (0) but will never return the top number (5). If you wanted it to return numbers 1 - 5, then just alter the call to floor(random(1,6)).

Also, floor is unnecessary. If you wanna look really smart and have faster performance, use the binary operator '~~'.

~~(random(0,5));

Check it out:

var r = random(0,5);

println(floor(r));
println(~~(r));

Good question! There are some custom CSS properties that control the scrollbar.

                border-radius: 4px;

The top one controls general stuff about the size of the scrollbar. The bottom one controls how it looks - colored red with rounded borders (that's what border-radius does). Try playing around with these values!

Setting the frameRate to 100 is a great way to make a timer work, although it's a bit of a problem if you're using it in a game. If you're doing a game, I'd suggest just directly checking frameCount.

Firstly, you must understand that OOP is different from plain objects - you can access objects directly by calling them by name:

*var obj = {
x: 10,
y: 5
};
println(obj.x); // prints 10*

With OOP, we create an object that we can then create instances from using the *new* keyword (i.e. var winston = new Winston()).

So now we get to your question. *Winston* is the main OOP object, so we won't ever be referencing *Winston* except to create new copies of the object. The function you're mentioning takes one parameter, an object - ideally a copy of the *Winston* object. So we're just mentioning that in the function, the parameter which holds a *Winston* object.

Please ask if you have any questions, I might not be totally clear about what you want to be answered.

An object is a container of named values.

`var obj = {
x: 100,
y: 100
};`

Parameters in functions enable us to pass custom information to the function instead of basing it off of the same thing or randomness.

`var myFunction = function(param) {
obj.x = param; // sets the obj.x to whatever was in param
};`

So the difference is that an object is a container of data, while a function with parameters allows us to specify data. Please ask for clarification if needed, your question was a bit hard to follow so I just generalized.

Hi there! I'd be happy to answer some questions :)

1. About 5 years ago on Scratch. I spent 4 years there on and off, then moved here to KA. Here is where I started programming seriously.
2. I grew up playing Scratch games, and I was amazed what you could do with just some simple blocks. I always wanted to be the one who could make games like that, the one who inspired others.
3. That's a really loaded question. It honestly depends on what I'm making and how long my interest lasts. We'll average and call it around a week.
4. Games are the best. It's wonderful to take an idea and implement it into a player that jumps around the screen :D
5. PJS all the way. Even though it's outdated garbage, it can still do some really cool things.
6. Ask questions. The community here is super valuable in that we have a bunch of people who are more than willing to answer your questions.

Yes, it is! There are several ways to do it, but I'll show you the easiest way.

`var keys = [];
keyPressed = function() {
keys[keyCode] = true;
};
keyReleased = function() {
keys[keyCode] = false;
};
`

Then you can call keys like this, in a draw loop:

`draw = function() {
if (keys[LEFT]) {
println("Left key is pressed");
}
};`

To do specific keys, you have to find the keyCode for the object. Go into a new program and put this line of code in:

`
draw = function() {
println(keyCode);
};`

Then press whatever key you want to check, and use that number inside the key checking.

`draw = function() {
println(keys[90]); // check for the 'z' key
};`

First off, I didn't make that part. WalkWorthy (@PowerCoder) did, but I'll try to explain it anyway.

Using the modulus operator (%), we're able to cycle through frames. Every sixth of a second, the costume is changed to the next one - this is possible by using a basic timer property that we have thanks to the modulus operator.

`if (frameCount % 5 === 0) {}`

This means every time that `frameCount % 5 = 0`, we switch to the next frame. Just basic timer stuff.

I would encourage you to google the modulus operator if you haven't heard of it. I use it _all_ the time while I'm coding for bullet fire rates and the like. It's incredibly useful for making timers that execute a function every time a certain time interval has elapsed.

Let's think about this - there are two possible solutions.

1) Use randomness to control the color of the fish. It would be a little difficult to find the right colors, and you wouldn't have control of what color each fish was. It would also create a multicolor problem if we incorporated a draw loop.

2) Pass the color through a parameter. This way, you control the exact color of the fish and it takes care of some bugs that would occur if we used randomness. I'm going to take this approach as it seems easier.

To accomplish this, just write your function to take a color parameter where you'll pass a color (ex. color(255, 100, 0)). Then when you're drawing the fish, fill it with the color.

Then when you call the fish function, include a color as a parameter and you'll be set.

Hi Katie!

First off, a `keyPressed()` function does not need to be put in a `draw` loop. I think what you're trying to do is keypress detection (i.e. finding what keys are pressed), and there's a _much_ easier way to do it.

Start off with this code.

`var keys = [];
keyPressed = function() {
    keys[keyCode] = true;
};
keyReleased = function() {
    keys[keyCode] = false;
};`

Now keypress checking is a breeze! You're trying to see if the up arrow is pressed, and then printing the message "ww". Let's make the program so it does just that!

You can use our new system to make it a lot easier. For example, checking if the up arrow is pressed is as simple as:

`if (keys[UP]) {
    // up arrow is pressed!
}`

Make sure to put this in a draw loop. So your program would now look like this:

`draw = function() {
    if (keys[UP]) {
        println("ww");
    }
}`

Any key can be called this way, such as the down arrow.

`if (keys[DOWN]) {
    // down arrow is pressed!
}`

Hope this helps. Shoot me a message if you don't understand something :)

`keyReleased = function() {

Now, you can call keyboard controls in the following manner.

`if (keys[LEFT]) {
    // move left
}`

Hi Kav!

Yes, it wouldn't show anything because the rectangle is both out-of-view and non-existant. Let me explain:

The first parameter is the x coordinate.
The second parameter is the y coordinate.
The third parameter is the width. You have it at 0, so the rectangle is 0 pixels wide - non-existent.
The fourth parameter is the height. You have it at 0, so the rectangle is 0 pixels high - non-existent.

The fifth parameter of rect is the border-radius. It curves the rectangle. If you don't want a curved border, just leave it blank (it's an optional parameter).

1. For the `.speak()`, your function needs to accept a parameter. It should look more like this:

`SmileyFace.prototype.speak = function(message) {
textSize(30);
text(message, this.centerX-90,300);
};`

Then when you're calling `.speak()`, you just put a message in the parentheses.

`face.speak("Hello there!");`

Actually, you'll learn later how to do that :)
In the Advanced JS: Games and Visualizations course, they teach you how to translate the coordinate plane to the center of the canvas. Just wait and see :D

Of course waiting is boring, so here's some quick code to do just that!

`point(0,0);` // draws a point in the top left corner of the canvas.

`pushMatrix();
translate(width/2,height/2);
// anything you draw in here will be like you want it.
point(0,0); // draws a point in the _middle_ of the canvas.
line(0,0,-200,-200) // draws a line from the center of the canvas to the top left corner!
popMatrix();`

So basically just put `pushMatrix();` at the beginning of your code, `translate(width/2,height/2);` right after that, and then `popMatrix();` at the end of your code!

You might still encounter some problems because you don't understand, that's fine. As I said, you'll learn about _all_ of this later.

`pushMatrix();

     fill (0, 237, 4);

     ellipse(100 + 62, 100, 70, 60);
     ellipse(100-62, 100, 70, 60);
     //right cloud
     fill (242, 242, 242);
     ellipse(284, 166, 126, 97);
     ellipse(168 + 60, 165, 70, 60);

The variable i is the incremented variable. It's the variable that is changed every time we go through the loop, and it's super helpful for checking if it's time to break out of the loop yet.

In your code, i is activated with the value 0 (note the word var, for activating a variable). Every time we go through a loop, we check if "i is less than xPositions.length". If it is, then we break out. If not, we'll keep going. The last parameter increments the variable by a certain amount, in your case, 1.

So here's the basic rundown:
for (declare the variable and set it equal to something; check to see if we should break out of the loop yet; increment the variable by a certain amount) {}.

Hope this helps, if not, please tell me and I'll go more in detail.

Say you're making a game and you need to know when the player presses the arrow keys, which will move the player around.
There are several ways to use `keyCode` for this type of situation, a big way being the simple key checker to see if a key is pressed. Here's how it works:

`var keys = {};
keyPressed = function() {
   keys[keyCode] = true;
};
keyReleased = function() {
   keys[keyCode] = false;
};`

With the above code in place, we can now just use a checking code by means of an `if () {}` conditional.

`if (keys[65]) { // 65 is the keyCode of the letter "A"
   println("key pressed");
} else {
   println("key not pressed");
}`

A final note: if you don't know the keyCode of a character, then use this script.

keyPressed = function() {
    println(keyCode);
};

Hello again :)

JavaScript can be practiced in a lot of different environments, but the JS you are learning right now, processing.js, is not exactly the JS you can use everywhere.
Processing.js is a JavaScript library, and it's not the same thing as the JS you can build into webpages and such. The syntax is mainly the same (such as `var` to declare variables and `var myFunction = function() {}` to make a function, but all of PJS does not work in a webpage.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that there isn't really another great place to practice coding with the PJS library, but when you start to learn JavaScript for building with HTML in webpages, there are a ton of great editors out there.

*Others* - correct me if I'm wrong or if you know another place where there is a good PJS editor, I just haven't found one as of the current moment.
? DATE: 12/17/2021, 12:05:06?PM
*EDIT*: Just realized you were talking about JS and not HTML XD
Ignore this then; it's a guide to HTML, *not* JS.

Hi Ashi!

Yes, we can absolutely change the font of text and make text italic or bold. Take a look below:

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>New webpage</title>
        
        <style>
            p {
                font-family: Arial;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <p>This is my sample webpage!</p>
    <p>Using tags, we can make text <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i>.
    </p>


    </body>
</html>`

Try inputting the code above into a blank HTML project (found here: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/webpage)

To explain the code, I'll start with making the text bold. Bold text is made by putting <b></b> tags around the text you want to make bold.
Next is italic. We can made text italicized by placing the <i></i> tags around it.
Another way of decorating text is underlining. This is accomplished by placing <u></u> tags around the text to be underlined.

In conclusion:
<b>Hello</b> --> *Hello*
<i>Hello</i> --> _Hello_

Fonts are harder, and you will learn more about them later in the HTML course.
There is a tag in the <head> of the webpage that says <style>. See it? Inside this tag goes all the properties that help us style text and do things like changing the font.
Now look at the line with a "p {" on it. This line and the next two lines are modifying all <p> tags (So all of our text in the body of the webpage). Under that line you see "font-family: Arial". This is the font! You can change "Arial" to any font you want, but a lot of fonts don't work in the KA environment. :(

Hope this clears some things up. Don't hesitate to reach out if you're having problems :)

`var x = 65; // declaring our variable

if (x > 50 && x < 75) {

Basically we can check 2 things at once if we use a more advanced comparer, such as `&& (AND)`, `|| (OR)`, or `! (NOT)`. I'm using `&&`, which checks if x is greater than 50 and less than 75.

    fill(255, 0, 0);
    rect(0,0,mouseX,mouseY);
};

? DATE: 12/12/2021, 3:22:14?PM
It's always good to use proper capitalization of keywords and things like that. And, I don't believe writing code with incorrect capitalization works in the PJS environment. So yeah, always use correct capitalization when writing code.

On another note, writingThingsLikeThis uses a capitalization standard called camel case, in which you keep the first word lowercase, but capitalize the first letter of all the other words. Programmers use this _a lot_ in things like naming variables, because it makes the words easier to see. (writing "ballspeed" vs. "ballSpeed"). Not particularly related to your question, but interesting nevertheless. 

Good luck as you continue with coding, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have further trouble :)

Hi Optimus!

I'm not much of a game developer, but I can tell you that arrays are incredibly useful in programming games and other applications. You probably haven't learned about objects in JS yet, but when you do you will begin to appreciate arrays more.

In the end, you just have to learn about arrays knowing that you'll use them later for bigger, more important things. Arrays are used in both game walkthroughs in the Advanced JS: Games and Visualizations course here on KA. In other words, they are incredibly fundamental pieces of programming that you'll _need_ to know.

Now, it sounds to me like you're having trouble looping through arrays. Looping through arrays is another important part of programming, so we'll walk through that too.

We will be building a program that loops through an array and prints that data in it.

Start by making an array: 
`var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`

Next, we'll incorporate the  for loop:
`for(var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {}`

Here's what we're saying: variable i = 0. Every time we loop through, check this condition (i < numbers.length). FYI, adding ".length" on the end of the name of an array returns it's length, so for this array it would return 9. Then if the condition is _false_ (variable i is not greater than the length of the list), we increment (add one to) variable i. If the condition is _true_, then we break out of the loop and continue with the program.

Now inside the brackets, we put this:
`println(numbers[i])`

This prints the item of the array according to variable i. So if i = 4, it prints "5" (because arrays start at 0, not one.

Here is all the code: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new-program/6742288074063872

Oh, and a final note: you don't have to name the variable i. You can name it anything you want.

Good luck as you continue with your coding journey, and don't hesitate to reach out if you're having trouble! :)

To select, you use the select command:
`SELECT * FROM songs;`

But sometimes, we want to be more specific and only select a specified amount of data. To do this, we just extend the select.
`SELECT * FROM songs *WHERE* artist = "Queen";`

The `WHERE` command specifies our search, so it only prints out songs that have the artist marked as "Queen".

Hope this helps!

I basically just curved all the rectangles you had and it gave it a smoother look. This was accomplished by means of the 5th input in the `rect()` command block, "radius". The higher the radius, the more curved the rectangle (I used 6 as the input).

Also, I changed where they come onto the stage. Now they are draw outside of the stage, and drive into the screen instead of starting on it, which makes for a smoother look.

Happy coding!

`createFont(font)` creates a new font.
Example: `createFont("Trebuchet MS Bold");`

You can incorporate this in two ways.

`var t = createFont("Monospace");
textFont(t,20); // the 20 is the size of the text`

_OR_

`textFont(createFont("Monospace"),20);`

Although it is cleaner to use the variable, the second option works just fine as well.

As a final note, here are some fonts that I have found to work in the KA environment:

`"Monospace"
"Trebuchet MS"
"Trebuchet MS Bold"
"Comic Sans MS"
"Courier New"
"Garamond"
"Georgia"
"Trebuchet MS Italic"
"Times New Roman"
"Verdana"`

Make sure to always keep them as a string ("Monospace") and not as a variable (Monospace).

Happy coding!

There is a way. In the `<p></p>` you want to have the description for when you hold the mouse over it, try using this instead:

No, you can't. The reason is because when you initialize the variable `myName`, its value will be set to the variable `Chantal`. If you had a variable named `Chantal` earlier in the program and had set it to 1, then `myName` would also be set to 1.

You can draw another shape, but `line(100,100,100,100)` won't do anything. It just goes from point 100,100 to point 100,100; making a dot. Try this code: 

`ellipse(100,100,40,40);`

It draws another shape. Just be careful about what coordinates you are plugging in to the inputs :D

The problem with your code is that everything is drawn within a `draw = function()`, which means that when the mouse is clicked an ellipse will be drawn, but it will immediately be erased because it is not in the draw function. Sorry if that doesn't make any sense, just take a look at my altered code listed below.

*The solution*: We want to have the new rocks be shown, so we will have to find some way to draw them  _inside_ the loop. This will be accomplished by having arrays that holds the values of the rock coordinates, and then we just constantly loop through those arrays to draw the new rocks!

`var rock_X = [];
var rock_Y = [];
`
Put this next code _inside_  the `draw = function()`.

`for (var i = 0; i < rock_X.length; i++) {
   fill(110,79,6);
   stroke(13,13,13);
   ellipse(rock_X[i],rock_Y[i],20,20);
}`

Lastly, we need to update your `mouseClicked` function. Put the following code outside of the draw function (where your `mouseClicked` function is now).

`mouseClicked = function() {
   rock_X.push(mouseX);
   rock_Y.push(mouseY);
}`

And that should work. If it doesn't, or if you have any more questions, please comment. Hope this helps!

*Note*: there are several more ways to accomplish this, but the way I showed is the simplest. If you want another way, just comment and I'll show you.

The `switch/case/break` commands are like putting multiple `if` loops together. Here's what I mean:

`if (costume === 1) {
   fill(0, 0, 0);
}
if (costume === 2) {
   fill(255, 0, 0);
}
if (costume === 3) {
   fill(0, 255, 0);
}
rect(200,200,40,40);`

The above script will switch the fill color of the rectangle based on the variable `costume`. A `switch` statement accomplishes basically the same thing.

`switch (costume) {
   case 1:
      fill(0, 0, 0);
      break;
   case 2:
      fill(255, 0, 0);
      break;
   case 3:
      fill(0, 255, 0);
}`

When using the `switch` conditional, just remember to always use a break command, because otherwise it would just run that conditional forever and never break out of it! Hope this helps.

`var keys = {};

   keys[keyCode] = true;
}

keyReleased = function() {

A half ellipse is accomplished by means of the `arc()` function.

`arc(x,y,width,height,start,stop);`

It takes six parameters (shown below).
*x*: the x position of the arc
*y*: the y position of the arc
*width*: the width of the arc
*height*: the height of the arc
*start*: the angle at which the arc starts
*stop*: the angle at which the arc stops

This can be a bit confusing, so let's look at an example.

`arc(200,200,40,40,0,180);`

Try inputting the above code into a program. It draws a semicircle. You can change how it looks by altering the start and stop values. From there, to make a semicircle is simple.

`// new and improved semicircle
arc(200,200,40,40,0,180);
line(180,200,220,200);`

You could make all kind of functions to draw semicircles without manual work, and I might edit this post with one later. But these are the basics. Hope this helps!

Also, please check out the documentation on the `arc()` function, found at https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/arcx-y-w-h-start-stop/1903619297

The way you would get that effect would be to use the sin() function on a gradually increasing number. For example:

    background(250, 250, 250);
    fill(0, 0, 0);
    rect(width/2,height/2,30,sin(i*30)*20);
    i += 0.1;
};`

Think of it as combining two different CSS scripts. We can say this:

p {
 background-color: yellow;
  }

which means that the background color of all content listed under a paragraph tag will have a background color of yellow. However, say we make a id and call it #idcontent, then we say that all content under this id will have a red underline. If we then write this code:

<p id="idcontent">This is a line of code</p>

the text will show up underlined with red and with a background color of yellow. Therefore, we combine two classes without having to make a completely different class, which saves time.
