Hmm, I think JS is still involved in showing the text. A better way to phrase the question would be, "What language that uses tags displays this text?"

I meant for loading the model. The model itself would have to be load off-site as the model data cannot be directly imported. That aside, I would then create the model, save it to `localstorage`, read the model in the manner you are suggesting, then replicate that model here.

Precisely. I was going to import it through an approved CDN, but needed to test that it was feasible first.

Okay.

Yes, I am working in the HTML environment. Uh, unless I entirely messed up my `fetch` call, I think the use of `fetch` is discouraged in this environment. It is a case-specific problem, correct.

Okay.

I would have to read the `localstorage` after running the script locally or somewhere else off-site, and I simply haven't gotten around to it.

Not to sound rude, but I think you missed the memo from before. Tensorflow.js needs the *model* not just the JSON object storing the *model data* in `localstorage`. It has nothing to do with serializing and everything to do with the formatting of the model. The only way to properly import the model to KA is to save the model locally, then read the `localstorage` item and import that here. What you did was act like my object is the entire model itself rather than just the data.

Oh, this is an old test. :)
I didn't save my most recent changes as they didn't work either.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method. The current issue is with the weird formatting that is necessary for Tensorflow.js to parse the object, which would mean `localstorage` or `indexeddb` could be used but the formatting issue is still in play.

You could, but I am not sure what that would accomplish. Also (not to sound rude, simply an observation), The Wogglebug already mentioned serializing the object in his most recent response.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

For the Wogglebug:
The issue seems to arise from the nature of the import of the JSON object. The error may be on my end(?), but it appears as though an external URL may be needed. Or I figure out how Tensorflow.js stores its models in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`.

Hey there, Rob!

Technically, this is ML not AI, but I'd be glad to get some help!

A `Blob` URL didn't work as it still violates the CSP directive. I have to avoid using the default `fetch` function due to the sandbox's restrictions, so the Wogglebug's approach may be the most feasible method.

"Basic" seems to be lower than my skill level, but the community here seems to be much better than anywhere else for a teen developer.

Sure thing.
~ DATE: 7/4/2023, 8:08:34 PM ~
Not yet. A friend referred me here after they referred me to Scratch. Not trying to throw shade, but Scratch seems a little basic. Thinking about getting a GitHub, Replit, and Dev-to account soon, after being referred there by a fullstack developer. 

Nice to meet you as well.

I did not join all that long ago with this account; you are correct. This is not my first Khan Academy account; yes, however, my old account is used only for school, so I don't think I am an "alt" in the way that you are thinking of it.

I only know about the CSP here due to a test I ran to import a Tensorflow.js model to Khan Academy. I have developed quite a bit locally on my computer for personal projects as well as building some applications for students at my school. Just another teen developer. :)

When you import a script, you simply import the text, and the text is run in the script tag you created locally. Here that is in the sandbox.

An alt? I am not sure what you mean. Could you elaborate?

That's a hard bargain to drive and highly unlikely, but I'll take your word for it.

I tried and did not have a successful result. Do you have a working demonstration of directly importing a JSON file into KA? For my purposes, Tensorflow.js should not need write permissions; furthermore, the current error I am getting is a CSP/CORS error in the console.

The main issue I am having is that `tf.loadGraphModel` and `tf.loadLayersModel` do not accept the JSON object itself but rather the URL that directs the function to the JSON object. However if the model is stored in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`, the model has to be stored in a particular format that I do not know. Tensorflow.js expects the developer to use their `model.save` method to store in `localStorage` or `indexedDB` rather than for the developer to do it themselves.

Ah, that kind of progress. =D

Oh, whoops. I guess I didn't clarify. I mean a ML model. I have a TensorFlow model I created locally that I've converted into a Tensorflow.js model, in JSON. My issue is trying to use Tensorflow.js to import the model as KA stops me from importing JSON files. The solution, in theory, would be assigning the object to a variable, using `JSON.stringify`, and then sending that string to Tensorflow.js. Tensorflow.js accepts `localstorage` and `indexeddb` URLs, but I haven't figured out how to send the JSON object in the right format to either as it seems to be a web browser-specific example.
The two methods in question are `tf.loadGraphModel` and/or `tf.loadLayersModel`.

Please let me know if you need me to clarify. I probably sounded incoherent.

ChatGPT wasn't fond of naming its program "test". =P

@PT
Unless KA or OpenAI do smth in the near future that lets us import a query to ChatGPT.

@Aryansh
It is simply misleading. It is simply clickbait. Sure you can name a project whatever you like, and I get to criticize the project's name however I like. You're free to say whatever you like, and so am I. :) You can ignore what I have to say if you would like, and I don't mean any harm by it. I simply wish for the other users in the KACP to be well-informed. To be fair, a plethora of gaming franchises use the term AI to truly mean CPU as the computer's algorithm doesn't hold any intelligence.

Speaking of ChatGPT, here's a very, very simple definition of artificial intelligence: "Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, is like having a smart robot friend that can think and learn just like humans do. It's a special kind of technology that helps computers do things that usually only people can do. AI can understand and talk to us, play games, solve problems, and even help with important tasks like finding information or driving cars. It's a bit like having a really clever helper that can do things on its own without needing constant instructions." Artificial intelligence implies that the program learns and makes decisions based on past knowledge and completely independent from the programmer. In this case, you are force-feeding the data to the chatbot, and the chatbot cannot respond on its own and is completely dependent on the programmer; thus, this is not artificial intelligence, and I find it misleading to label it as such. However, you label it however you like, ;P.

"What coding language was this programmed in?"

This question is quite misleading. The site was programmed in CSS, HTML, and JS, but only HTML is accepted. Additionally, experienced front-end and full-stack developers argue fervently that HTML is not its own programming language as it is simply a container for other languages, namely CSS and JS. Furthermore, HTML has no way to store variables, no iteration, no methods, no conditionals, etc.
