Ello _=D_
I was just about to say you should go ahead and start. 

If you guys don't want to make one universal block then you guys can make separate block pieces for corners and such.
• DATE: 3/10/2023, 11:42:26 AM
Isn't it easier to shoot straight and add sin/cos to give the bullet a curve?
• DATE: 3/8/2023, 4:43:07 PM
Alr thanks _=D_

@akbaba
Nope. I mean real puzzles like super quick mini-games/challenges for the player. 

@DR
Thanks _=D_
• DATE: 3/7/2023, 8:26:51 PM
Yep. 

Here's what we still need:

Player movement (_Astro_)

Enemy AI (_YokieBob + Astro_) - Shooting bullets toward the player in an arc manner. I'll meet you on your program for more info.

Graphics (_Nico and Aqua_) - You two can decide on any theme, after all this is a team collab so I'd like to see what you two can come up with. You two together will be making blocks and the background skyline. Astro will be making the player. 

Map development (_DR_) - Your task is to take YokieBobs physics and turn it into a generable bitmap map with camera movement. 

Puzzles (_Chase + Akbaba_) - I want you both to come up with 1-2 different puzzles. These can be anything. Once again make anything you'd like.


Also, how many of you guys will be active during the weekend?
• DATE: 3/7/2023, 8:10:15 PM
So sorry. I was busy the last 4 days. I've created a new chat thread with a better plan of our final project

* _Boom_ *

Mr maple syrup has spawned.
• DATE: 3/2/2023, 8:41:11 AM
_O.o_
What about a worn down dead cyberpunk kinda theme?
• DATE: 3/2/2023, 8:22:36 AM
Hello, We are making a platformer with a normal dude with movement inspired by angry birds and a project that still has a really fuzzy direction. Art style - flat art.
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 8:56:29 PM
@Akbaba
By stickiness I mean the player can hang onto walls. I vision wall climbing and such with this feature. Maybe this could be a reward the player earns instead?

The tasks will be more specific once we get the foundation down by the end of this week.

@Niko 
A rigged character. Let me see if I can find an example

@Chase
yea. You wanna make program?
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 2:10:23 PM
Yep. Forget stickiness. That's me and Chase's job.
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 1:58:20 PM
Nope. The collisions are circle to rect so the player can look normal.
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 1:14:36 PM
Nah. Just make a normal graphic. The platformer will have circle-Rect physics. It's not medieval themed.
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 11:48:37 AM
And my comment didn't go through. 

Ok...

1. Aqua will be here shortly
2. Here's the groups with tasks that should be done by Friday:

Astro, Chase => Player movement (launcher)
DR, YokieBob, Akbaba => platformer physics (circle-rect)
Nico, Aqua => Player graphic (Short chubby dude with a beard, flat art style)
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 11:15:38 AM
Yep. Aqua was inactive for the last 5 days. I just got her response. It'll be in by the end of today.

Sorry for taking so long
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 10:08:02 AM
@Aqua 
Forget the menu _=p_
It's already really late. I'll add the diver and submit it in the next couple hours.

Could you report to the final collab chat thread?
https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/final-project/4565656077123584
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 8:12:13 AM
I'm not sure about aqua's activity. Let's give it some time. 

Anyway I've got an idea which involves some of our past projects as well _=p_

1. platformer type map 
2. No movement. You know how in angry birds you shoot birds at objects? Well, instead of moving with arrow keys, you'll launch yourself from block to block. You stick/grab onto to the blocks you land on. 
3. You fight enemies by flying into them. 
4. Once you get to the end of the level you play a mini-game/puzzles which reward the player with something.

Along with time we can add sidequests like collecting things or something
• DATE: 2/28/2023, 8:23:33 AM
morning _=D_
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 8:42:45 PM
Alr. So Liam said we go big or we go home. We can recreate something like hollow knight and die or make something original
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 8:17:12 PM
That's perfect _=D_

I'm working on the graphic's rn on a different program, and the rest of the code should be relatively easy. I'll work on it tomorrow as well and submit it late.
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 8:14:34 PM
Hello. Alright here's the plan. 

Based on last round big groups of collabs tend to be really hard to mange and people tend to be left out. (Credit to DR for the observation)

So I've decided the best method is to work in pairs. I need your opinions on this:

`Mon - Tues: Game plan & groups with assigned tasks
Wed - Fri: Finish the tasks each pair was responsible for
Weekend: Put everything together
Mon-Wed: Split up and sort out & finish our next top priorities. 
Wed - Fri: Finish the game
Weekend: Juicing, Level/Map design, clean up
Monday: Release`
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 5:53:32 PM
Correction. Maple Syrup is part of a different collab _=p_
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 5:04:28 PM
Let's the name it a theme:

'Into the deep'
or 
'Into the depth'

I like the second one more
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 4:06:47 PM
@Chase
Page transtitions

@aqua
diver graphic & menu (mainly the diver graphic)

Once your done post the link to the program below. I'm gonna get this done by the end of today.
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 4:04:33 PM
Ello _=D_

No idea. Let's let the rest of the team pour in as we come up with ideas. I'm creating a timeline based on activity rn so we don't do the same thing as last round.
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 4:00:22 PM
Team, report here for the final project:
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/4565656077123584
• DATE: 2/27/2023, 3:47:12 PM
@YokieBob
Go ahead and try it. 

@DR
Don't push yourself. It was just a suggestion.
• DATE: 2/26/2023, 4:41:13 PM
Ok.....

@aqua
diver => side view, swimming, separate parts (legs and body) for rigging. 
An example can be seen in the graphic reference at the top of the code.
 
Just try to finish the diver and the possible menu design (second reference) by the deadline. I understand life comes first.

@Chase
I've seen some people hardcode a transition _=p_
• DATE: 2/25/2023, 4:14:13 PM
I see....

Nice _=D_

Ok. Maybe:
1. Text 'Natureopolis' on the left of the nav bar like a logo
2. Or center the buttons
3. Or make the nav bar bend _=p_
Just some random ideas.
• DATE: 2/25/2023, 3:45:21 PM
@Chase
Any kind works _=D_
Just something to transition from the menu to the game. Could you make it a function?
• DATE: 2/24/2023, 10:49:16 PM
Yikes! I posts something 3 days ago but it seems it didn't go through. New plan:

@aqua - Graphics
- Diver
- Coarl?
- Cave  entrance

@Chase
Page transitions
and something I can't remember, rn.

My timezone is EST.
• DATE: 2/21/2023, 3:30:43 PM
@DR
Decent _=p_
aqua can't make graphics till Friday. Otherwise, we've got all the physics. Working on the gameplay rn.

@Niko
I know _lol_
• DATE: 2/21/2023, 3:19:23 PM
Np _=D_

Just checking up on your group's collab. I wouldn't call that stalking _=p_
• DATE: 2/20/2023, 11:02:39 AM
Same here

I guess if we're both free today, we can wipe out a huge portion of the core mechanics?
• DATE: 2/18/2023, 12:09:50 PM
Lets aim for a sci-fi type of cartoonish graphics. Something like Space-X's flight suits _=p_

As for graphics rn I suggest starting with coral. Different types of coral in size and color?


As for the character, I'll be rigging it later.
• DATE: 2/18/2023, 12:05:26 PM
Explaining time _=D_

After Team Henry disbanded each team is allowed a seventh member. So instead of looking for a new one YokieBob's coming back _=D_
• DATE: 2/17/2023, 10:33:41 PM
_lol_
No offense taken. Why would I be mad? 
I was just curious on the score I was giving and wanted to know what I could do better next time to improve _=D_
• DATE: 2/17/2023, 7:17:35 PM
@Chase 
It doesn't matter what the height and width is. I'll be catching every graphic as an image so they can be rescaled to fit our needs. (This method is one of the key reasons some game devs like me and Liam can run programs at max framerate)
• DATE: 2/17/2023, 4:48:15 PM
Ah, I've finished both circle and line collisions as well as circle physics. Still gotta do line physics. 

@To-do
We can just divide and conquer

Also love that bio _=D_
• DATE: 2/17/2023, 4:27:16 PM
Ah, bullets randomly also generate throughout the map. I added it after people were complaining that the game was too hard to make movement slightly easier.
• DATE: 2/17/2023, 4:25:43 PM
Huh, I thought I saw a seven avg yesterday. Oh well. I just have two questions:

Efficiency (3) => The codes been optimized to an insane degree and runs at each computer's max framerate. May I know why the score's so low?
Cleanliness (4) => Another place I'm confused about. The code's indented and neatly placed in IIFE's. How can I make it cleaner?

Thanks _=D_
• DATE: 2/17/2023, 1:49:50 PM
Actually, yesterday, Liam allowed every team to pick a seventh member. We were is just looking for a new member, so you coming back is perfect _=D_

Currently, we're in round 3 (2 groups). The other collab group needs more help. Could you report to the collab thread in the program below:

The whole game plan should be done in about 30-ish minutes.
• DATE: 2/16/2023, 7:15:50 PM
Thank you _=D_
Loading all the comments is pretty annoying.
• DATE: 2/16/2023, 7:14:32 PM
I've posted some image references in the comments in the code of this program. Is that a good theme we should aim for?
• DATE: 2/16/2023, 7:07:08 PM
Nice. I might make a different character design later to fit the theme. 

I'm almost done with the plan and to-do list
• DATE: 2/16/2023, 5:56:43 PM
The flickering is a result of the gradient loop being run several times a second. 

I'll touch up to movement later when I finish the collisions.
• DATE: 2/16/2023, 5:52:41 PM
Thanks _=D_

There shouldn't be any invisible enemies...

Right now I just click on your profile and use the discussion for quick access.
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 6:34:58 PM
Alr _=D_
Wait. Do I pick a seventh member to even out the teams or do the rest of the teams remain at 6?
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 6:31:45 PM
I think they could just stay below the ocean. Or they could start at the top and the rest of the game's underwater?
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 5:26:02 PM
Yep. Seems good. The only thing we might want to postpone till later if we have time is the gear upgrades. Also, the lights might ruin the whole fantasy vibe but only time will tell.

Are the custom collisions going to be lines & circles or curves.
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 5:21:49 PM
Thanks _=D_
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 5:21:38 PM

I believe we decided on the it was the explorer idea
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 12:17:11 PM
Yeah. I thought so. For now, we could start with the player movement.
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 11:47:48 AM
Thanks _=D_
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 11:47:34 AM

Are collisions going to be blocked like a platformer or free-handed/custom?
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 11:22:35 AM
No problem _=D_

• DATE: 2/15/2023, 11:07:05 AM
Everything including the maps and enminey types and counts are randomly generated at the start of the game for more variety.
• DATE: 2/15/2023, 9:23:57 AM
Yeah. An explorer-type game with the objective to find something sounds cool _=D_

The graphics could be fantasy-type. I've posted a example of what I mean in the code.

Both don't exist so it doesn't matter _=p_

Shoot bullets to push yourself in the opposite direction.
• DATE: 2/14/2023, 9:32:35 PM

Alright. I'll implement that later today, when I get the chance. For now, I've just commented it out.

Are you in the new team chat thread?

I beg to differ _=p_
• DATE: 2/14/2023, 8:56:18 AM
For round 3 we have 2 ways we can split the team as we have 4 logic devs and 2 graphic devs. We can keep the two logic pairs with the addition of a graphic dev or both teams can work with new people.

So:
_Option 1_
Astro - DR - Aqua
Chase - Akbaba - Nico

_Option 2_
Astro - Chase - Aqua
DR - Akbaba - Nico

I prefer option 2. Opinions?
• DATE: 2/14/2023, 8:51:30 AM
Nope. The deadline has not been extended.

Alr.

YokieBob just had to drop out this Friday and I replaced him with Niko so currently, I have zero inactive members. 

Depending on how many people are inactive I would suggest rebuilding the team and finding substitutes.
• DATE: 2/12/2023, 3:46:27 PM

You'll be in a collab with aqua. You two have till Monday to make a project. Sorry for the short notice. I suggest you team up and make a graphic or you can finish what YokieBob started.

No. It's not a real question. So it doesn't need to be in the questions. And there's no need to flag anyone for putting it in the wrong place.
• DATE: 2/9/2023, 9:06:21 AM
Nope. Still six. TDJ's inactive
• DATE: 2/9/2023, 6:40:43 AM
@Aqua
That's actually really smart. No one's ever done that before. 

@YokieBob
Aqua wants you to make/finsh all the levels. For each level, Aqua wants to design it's very own unique background.
• DATE: 2/8/2023, 9:56:21 AM
Bullets coming from the player going to the mouse. (_Normal_) 
Yes.
• DATE: 2/8/2023, 8:06:19 AM
No problem _=D_
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 9:49:26 PM
If possible could you finish the task I gave you above by tomorrow? We're kinda behind on time.

I've 'found' a method that should work for the physics. I'll start the graphics till then.
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 9:20:23 PM
Update:
Since you represent the team, you should definitely join the rest of us in the captain's thread. I'm sure you know how to find it _=p_

(_has 0 votes_)
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 9:17:16 PM
Oh....That makes alot more sense. Night time here. I've got a solution that might work which I'll tell you about tomorrow.
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 7:31:56 PM
I've got a question from the current captain of Team Levi (Lemon).

He wants to know if he should be in this thread since he's a captain now...
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 7:30:00 PM
Hold up let me ask _=D_
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 5:25:36 PM
Which loopy circle SVG? They're all loopy and circle-ly. Make it a different color so I can see it _lol_
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 3:53:19 PM
Yeah. That's how it works on other programming platforms and communities. They might fix it. Threads with over a 100 comments take forever to open.
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 1:58:02 PM
1. New system. Pretty annoying. Tickets have already been filed. _lol_
2. Forgot to say this. If your teammates inactive let me know as soon as possible _=D_
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 1:56:41 PM
If they wanted they could've loaded the most recent comments like GitHub. But their starting at the top _=p_
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 12:24:53 PM
Yeah, what @YokieBob said. 

And you can ask questions. There's no rule against it _=D_
• DATE: 2/6/2023, 5:03:49 PM
Actually...
I didn't take into account the physics. So I'll work on that. Could you add player bullets (with knock back), and a map function with block collisions. Stuff you did last round.

Edit: Feel free to use es6 by disabling jshint _=D_
• DATE: 2/4/2023, 12:46:07 PM
Dreams and Nightmares is a great theme which was really popular last year for CoC

It'd be cool if you guys manage to do something with that _=D_
• DATE: 2/3/2023, 9:03:46 PM
* oof * _lol_
But...that's the thing I like the most about Agent X. He's unique. Probably the most known and popular judge on KA _=p_
• DATE: 2/3/2023, 6:11:13 PM
@Agent
That was a nice collab. Reminds me of the good days. What would you give it? 9/10?

_lol_
• DATE: 2/3/2023, 5:23:55 PM
What would you rate the 'stick with it' collab that was never finished?
• DATE: 2/3/2023, 3:54:46 PM
I'm pretty sure you're part of the judging for round 1 according to the list...so yes?

https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/5200922808729600
• DATE: 2/3/2023, 3:15:06 PM
Some sort of complex landscape. Show us your perspective of utopia _=D_
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 8:42:57 PM
Yep _=D_
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 8:42:06 PM
In short => dis-c@rd

Long story behind the real reason it's called khancord.
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 8:27:30 PM
Yea. I saw. Khancord's a great place _=D_
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 8:17:11 PM
Ello,
Just checking in. I obviously can't help you guys but if you have any questions about the challenge let me know _=D_
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 8:16:06 PM
Ello,
Just checking in. I obviously can't help you guys but if you have any questions about the challenge let me know _=D_

Also I kinda expected, that you'd like to work in a HTML environment. You might've seen this already but I created a graphic canvas library that works exactly the same as PJS, last week. If you'd like to use it I can export it into GitHub and run it through jsdelivr:
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/5637981507731456
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 1:09:26 PM
Nope. But some of the judges aren't in the new thread...
• DATE: 2/1/2023, 3:57:09 PM
Still broken. I suggest you just post your scores here. At least this thread still works _=p_

@IA
Not visible

@Liam
I can see yours _=D_
• DATE: 1/31/2023, 6:38:50 PM
Nice _=D_
What's the purpose of the first script tag with the messy code? Is it a library?
• DATE: 1/31/2023, 6:24:29 PM
Nice _=D_
Maybe do something about that black background. A fog/fade out or dark shade of grey would look nice instead of the pure black?
• DATE: 1/31/2023, 3:52:28 PM
Ah, alright then. 

@Chase & Akbaba 
You guys will be working with the Recreational Recreations theme _=D_
• DATE: 1/31/2023, 3:44:35 PM
Ello _=D_

Yikes! Team, I may has missed a important step in the paring round...
It seems I'm supposed to assign each team a theme to work on. Each pair must work on a different theme. However, I don't want to force you to work on a certain theme you don't want to work on. So I'll let you guys pick:

1 Contrast
2 Into the Deep
3 Recreational Recreations

Me and DR have already decided to work on Into the Deep. The rest is up to you.
• DATE: 1/31/2023, 8:52:30 AM
I can argue _lol_

It'll be the best game KA's seen in 2023 _=D_
• DATE: 1/31/2023, 6:37:03 AM
@YokieBob
Nope. I don't see it either. I suggest you submit it and let the judges know, so they don't deduce late points.
• DATE: 1/30/2023, 9:37:04 PM
Yep, new threads been created. @Everyone please report to the new thread 

As Akbaba said I suggest each pair moves to it own separate thread allowing them to discuss their projects privately without intervening with other collabs. Once each team started the collab they can post their WIP in the main team thread.
• DATE: 1/30/2023, 8:36:17 PM

• DATE: 1/30/2023, 3:22:13 PM
@Akbaba
Looks great _=D_
Maybe a menu?

@Everyone
You've got about ~10 hours left to submit your entries. Please submit them as soon as possible. 

I'm sure you've all already seen the post  but the next challenge has started,

Unless someone would like to change them we'll stick to the current pairings:
_Astro => DR
Aqua => Yokiebob
Akbaba => Chase_

This challenge requires us to follow one of the 3 themes (_See Liam's post on the CoC homepage_).
• DATE: 1/30/2023, 7:26:00 AM
We only have 6 members. TDJ's inactive. 

He'll be submitting everything he's got done for this challenge, as Chase didn't have a lot of time to make anything
• DATE: 1/30/2023, 7:23:56 AM
Team, deadline updates:

It's due by Midnight today your time. Once your done (or even if it's a WIP), please submit it in the submission thread which can be found here:
https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/clash-of-code-2023/6672599819534336?qa_expand_key=ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJACxIIVXNlckRhdGEiHWthaWRfMTYwNjUzMDc5NDYzOTkyMDg1MDkwNDI4DAsSCEZlZWRiYWNrGICAk6S29vsIDA&qa_expand_type=comment

We currently have 0 submissions.
• DATE: 1/29/2023, 11:42:32 AM
Yea. That would work _=D_
• DATE: 1/27/2023, 6:36:18 AM
Tectonic Horizon comes in to check the hotlist every week or so. But he doesn't make content anymore _=(_
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 9:10:17 PM
Or you can just throw it into the planet's draw loop _=p_
I've never actually tried that before. 

I don't see any lag rn but add this to kill KA's Loop protector:

`// Credit to Daniel (@dkareh)
(function() {return this;})().LoopProtector.prototype.leave = function() {};`
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 8:57:14 PM
Ahhhhh!

@aqua
I know why this didn't work:
_
return Math.pow(c.x - c2.x,2) + Math.pow(c.y - c2.y,2) <= Math.pow(c.r + c2.r,2);
_

Your pushing:
`
planets.push(new Planet());
`
into an array but calling `Planet.x,planet.y` in mine or YokieBobs function.  Run it through a loop.

It's nighttime here so I've got to go. If @YokieBob's still active he can help and show you how to do it, or I'll try to do it tomorrow _=D_
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 8:20:16 PM
@YokieBob
As aqua said, if you can finish it, to can restart _=D_

_____
So aqua and YokieBob seem to be a good pair and Chase gets to work with one of his inspirations. This worked out better than I expected _=D_
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 7:19:47 PM
Team, four days left for our individual entries _=D_

_____
For the next challenge, I was thinking of pairing peeps graphic & logic devs.

Something like this:

_Astro => DR
Aqua => Yokiebob
Akbaba => Chase_
What do you think?
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 5:37:04 PM
@ski
you weren't the only one around back then who's in this thread rn_=p_

_me
Mojo
Cowboy
ice (granted, he was gone for quite some time)_


He's so good _=D_
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 4:55:31 PM
That collides with TCW _=p_

But I'm sure TDJ won't mind
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 4:06:48 PM
I wouldn't consider it March. It always ends by the end of Feb or maybe a week into March, like this year.
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 3:29:58 PM
* cough *

List:
_CoC: Jan-Feb
Primavera: March-June
TCO: June-July
Khantober: October
TCW: Nov-Dec_

and i've had the honor to lead or participate in each competition in the past on various occasions with this account and my main.
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 6:39:32 AM
@ski
We're talking about all 'the greatest' KA devs.

@Mojo
There are so many amazing devs. Many undervoted devs too. As I said earlier the list would go on forever _=p_
• DATE: 1/25/2023, 9:25:20 PM
_lol_ Your 100 hundred lines are still impressive. I have about 600... It'll cross the 1K mark in a day or two. 

Alright, TDJ will submit his entry for this challenge. Since TDJ won't be active for next round though Chase is still part of the team. That way TDJ and Chase get to contribute to team _=D_
• DATE: 1/25/2023, 7:56:57 PM
That's strange. I don't see any immediate issues. I'll look into it tomorrow when I have time. 

I guess you can start graphics till then?
• DATE: 1/25/2023, 3:37:43 PM
Oh boy. . .

And I assume my team can't submit 7 entries.
• DATE: 1/25/2023, 3:16:19 PM
There's a lot of empty space...

Yep. I just realize you should add `rectMode(CORNER)` to the logo
• DATE: 1/25/2023, 3:14:18 PM
There are so many amazing coders _=D_
Your forgetting so many, but the list would go on forever _=p_
• DATE: 1/25/2023, 3:10:48 PM
@Cowboy

Let's say hypothetically a team members says he's going inactive and then decides to create an entry...

• DATE: 1/25/2023, 1:42:41 PM
@Akbaba
Sounds like alot of fun _=D_

@YokieBob
As long as you can finish/submit a decent entry by Monday I don't mind you restarting. 

It's looking great so far _=D_
• DATE: 1/25/2023, 1:39:24 PM
Yep. This thread was only temporary till each team created a homepage.
• DATE: 1/23/2023, 2:30:10 PM
No problem _=D_
Let me know if you need anything else _=D_
• DATE: 1/23/2023, 11:21:57 AM
I'm doing well. Got picked as a captain and school grades are amazing _=D_
You?

It sure has.
• DATE: 1/23/2023, 11:12:49 AM

• DATE: 1/22/2023, 9:12:53 PM
Ello _=D_
Welcome to the team!

I just created our team logo & intro. Links above. Any feedback?
• DATE: 1/22/2023, 9:08:44 PM
Alright then, welcome to Team Astronomers _=D_

You can find the team thread here:

_What if_ I code my whole project with 8 space indentation? Will you deduct points? _lol_
• DATE: 1/22/2023, 8:11:05 PM
@TDJ
No problem _=D_
Life's always top priority. Thanks for letting me know. 

@Team
Here's our team logo/intro. I was going to add an astronaut looking at the ship, but it seems like overkill:
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/6068861418127360

Feedback? I'm sure there's some way to improve this. To me, it feels really bland.
• DATE: 1/22/2023, 7:12:15 PM
Hey. Sorry, it took so long. I had exams this week. Finally finished your checkpoint system:
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/4832975401566208

Let me know if you have any more questions or you want to know how the system works _=D_
I should be free for the next month.
• DATE: 1/22/2023, 5:18:14 PM
@Chase
You willing to join a team?
• DATE: 1/21/2023, 10:35:59 PM
I have been enlightened _=D_

_lol_
• DATE: 1/21/2023, 9:14:31 PM
As custom to past drafts, the deadline's never been pushed back. The inactive member just wasted the team's time and the replacement just has to compensate for it...

But CBF might change it this year. Who knows?
• DATE: 1/21/2023, 7:50:30 PM
Trying to buy my team?

Like I said you've got to wait it out. My patience has led me to have a fully active team... _For now_
• DATE: 1/21/2023, 2:40:27 PM
@Akbaba
Can't wait to see what you make _=D_

I think I'll decrease the brightness slightly for the logo otherwise that's a nice shade of blue.
• DATE: 1/20/2023, 3:05:03 PM
Yep. And a intro.

@Akbaba
Each individual member has 10 days left (Till the 30th) to make whatever they want to showcase their best skills (preferably a game). Do you think you can submit a decent entry by then?
• DATE: 1/20/2023, 2:10:10 PM
We already have a logo in progress. It'll be done by monday.
• DATE: 1/20/2023, 9:25:34 AM
Hmmm....in that case I can replace Akbaba. He's reported to the thread once after four days of inactivity and he's yet to start his entry. No comments in three days...

@ski
You need to chill. The team doesn't need to grind every day. If they've started and actively report to the thread then you shouldn't kick them. Just my opinion _=D_
• DATE: 1/20/2023, 6:30:04 AM
Idea numero uno is much wow _=D_
Sounds like it could become a really cool game if you get the blobs working correctly. 

@YokieBob
Maybe turn the game into a puzzle? Find ways to fit/move blocks to certain places to open a door to the next level?
• DATE: 1/19/2023, 9:32:59 PM
@John
I see. I managed to do what DR did without the loop protector as I never used a 'loop'

Time to do it in WebGL _=p_
• DATE: 1/19/2023, 7:55:10 PM
@John
How many do you see here?
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/4619135934054400

It'll take a while to load bigger ones.
• DATE: 1/19/2023, 7:41:47 PM
@DR
yeah. I also want to know your idea _=p_
• DATE: 1/19/2023, 7:16:56 PM
I'm sure yours will be better though _=p_
This was made in about ~3 days.
• DATE: 1/19/2023, 7:13:22 PM
I manged to get 9 with the loop protector. 11 without it. 

@DR
You might want to try ImageData _=p_
• DATE: 1/19/2023, 7:04:35 PM
As instructed by the founder of CoC CowboyFans, I'm here to give you an insane motivational speech to start and work on your projects. Here goes nothing:

"_We the members of Team Astronomers have come together to show the world that we're better than team bob. This team isn't just about creating games and scoring points. It's about collaboration and fun. Each one of us present in this chat thread has worked really hard to get to this very occasion, so why should we give up now? We're an exceptional group of programmers prepared to help each other out and lead this team to victory. Winning won't be easy but it'll be all more fun if we try. 

We'll either win or lose together but I hope we all give this competition our best shot. Just remember that the members of team astronomers have got your back_"

_lol_
But in all seriousness, if you ever need help feel free to ask. Can everyone post links to their WIP's? 

Reminder: The due date for this challenge is Jan 30th. We've got about 11 days left
• DATE: 1/19/2023, 6:51:26 PM
_Yessir =D_
• DATE: 1/19/2023, 3:28:15 PM
Alright I've got Vertex, bezierVertex, and CurveVertex working _=D_

*smacks forehead*
I should've use the spread operator wayy earlier.
• DATE: 1/18/2023, 6:15:22 PM
I see.

Well I'm done for the day. I got vertex working and was going to start berzierVertex when I realized everything that uses beginShape and endShape can be combined so different arrays don't work. I have to make everything work in one array meaning everything needs to have a 'type' so endshape can detect which command I called.
• DATE: 1/18/2023, 12:24:45 PM
Yep. Nobody wanted Akbaba or Aqua _(Can you believe that?)_ and I manged to get my hands on TDJ early _=p_

But Paperwad's more stacked.
• DATE: 1/18/2023, 12:17:10 PM
here
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 8:24:20 PM
Ello. Just poping in _=p_

If you want it to work faster just go to js-Deliver and give it your repo link again. 

Also, add a specific version, instead of using `@latest`. It'll help update your files a lot quicker.
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 6:45:03 PM
Alright. I'll let you know if a member goes inactive _=D_

Nope. Not that I know of. 
Free Agents 'exists'
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 6:39:13 PM
@Akbaba
No problem _=D_
Happens to the best of us.
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 6:14:40 PM
I've sent Akbaba a message to join our thread.

For a substitute draft in case he doesn't respond, I'm thinking of asking Nico/Niko or Lime/Light coder to join our team. Opinions?
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 5:59:56 PM
Yep. It's nice to see you too.
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 5:54:47 PM
It used to be a ski's starky _lol_

`dat = () => {
  return 'dat'
}`

_=O_
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 4:17:15 PM
Ah, that makes a lot more sense.

Well, most of the captains have led other teams successfully. It all comes down to whose better _=p_
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 4:12:50 PM
_mango_?

I wouldn't put it like that. All the captains this year are really skilled.
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 11:10:51 AM
_O.o_
I'd love to know your reasons

Yep. Levi's doing the same thing.
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 10:45:07 AM
This might _not_ be my CoC entry. 

It was a test to see if I could recreate PJS in case we have to collab and YokieBob wants to use the canvas. 

Even if it doesn't dock points, I'd rather recreate my own version with functions that my team could possibly need without forcing them to use es6.
• DATE: 1/17/2023, 9:28:47 AM
I'll do an Astronaut. I'll make the intro responsive for any canvas size. 

Sounds like a cool idea. I've got two tests this Thursday and then I have all of next week to work on my project.

It's been five days. I'll wait till the end of today. I've started looking for other potential people to draft.

Alright. Team names: 'Astronomers'

Logo and intro will be out shortly. Any ideas on a style or design for the logo or intro? 

Also, what are you all working on?
• DATE: 1/16/2023, 6:16:08 PM
It doesn't sink. It simply needs more juice. Try adding fonts and animations. Maybe a page transition? 

I would help you but you're on the opposing team _=p_
I suggest you ask your team. Levi can surely help spice up your game.
• DATE: 1/16/2023, 2:37:50 PM
_O.o_
When you move your workspace cuz it's gained too much popularity, only for it to gain even more _=p_

How Team Levi going? Akbaba has yet to report to our thread.
• DATE: 1/16/2023, 2:23:32 PM
Hmm.... An RPG or Puzzle sounds cool.

I'm working on a medieval-style game that can double up as my contest entry.
• DATE: 1/16/2023, 12:07:14 PM
Well quality isn't a concern when your in CoC, the one competition where quality projects are guaranteed. Besides you can still do a lot while keeping traditions.

Yep. If you make a list of things every browser does differently it gets pretty long.

Nope. We can make anything. 

I'll get a team name, logo, and intro by the end of the day today _=D_

For CoC, I would try to aim for a game but graphics work too.
• DATE: 1/16/2023, 11:56:42 AM
Thanks _=D_

CoC homepages for the last two years tend to be as simple as possible. They're usually one-pagers. 

I see. I'll be aware of that from now on _=p_
• DATE: 1/16/2023, 11:51:48 AM
If you see some of my other homepages you'll see that I do use JS to insert members. 

But for a simple CoC homepage it's unessacary as we know there's only six members that aren't going to change.
• DATE: 1/16/2023, 11:49:08 AM
Seems like Polar's going all out with a react homepage on KA _=p_

2. Really? Who was the judge?
• DATE: 1/15/2023, 8:40:16 PM
_lol_
I can't believe I forgot that _=(_

Fixed
• DATE: 1/15/2023, 7:56:40 PM
It's the only comp you'll see with such simple homepages _=D_

Best of luck to your team too

1. That's what happens when you're used to 2 tab indents and use KA _=p_
2. I see. I'll note that down for later. 
3. Just a habit. It's a better coding practice for readability and accessibility.
4. Nope
• DATE: 1/15/2023, 7:08:11 PM
Yeah. A portion of the score is based on cleanness _=p_

Your team's pretty stacked too _=p_

Thanks _=D_
• DATE: 1/15/2023, 5:18:55 PM
The only name suggestion we've got so far is astronomers by Cowboy. 

Other teams are making rules, _some are questionable_ but I don't think we need any. Just:
1. _Run your code through a code formatter. 
2. Let the team know if your going to be inactive_

Also, even though this is an individual challenge there were not rules against not helping each other _=p_
• DATE: 1/15/2023, 5:10:42 PM
Well heres some news:

Teams will not be extended. Captains already voted and the majority doesn't want bigger teams.

But if a member of a team goes inactive during any point of the competition, we draft a new member, so you could still get in. My team itself seems like it already has one inactive member who hasn't reported to the team.
• DATE: 1/15/2023, 4:57:11 PM
1 => 
My bad. Terrible wording. By copying I meant similarity. I've seen several others use other devs templates of code with a similar coding style in hopes to gain popularity. Create something new and original. If you've always made platformers or dodge games then try something new. 

2&3 => 
Ah. When it comes to personal projects never focus on making only one game. If I'm working on a big game I tend to make serval smaller games in between to take breaks and try new things. 

Heres a pattern I used to follow:
_"Make two bad games (intentionally), and received feedback and learn. Then that that knowledge and put it together with your past mistakes and create a better game."_

I didn't become a captain out of nowhere. We all have our struggles.

 Both of you will make it to CoC and as always if you ever need help or have questions feel free to ask me _=D_
• DATE: 1/15/2023, 10:03:05 AM
It's been over 2 months since I've posted anything. I'm participating in CoC 2023 as a captain. Check out our homepage here:
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/5562534333825024

If you've asked me a question, but I didn't respond in the last couple weeks, it most likely got lost in my notifications, or I simply forgot. Feel free to ask me the same question again _=D_
• DATE: 1/14/2023, 8:00:25 PM

Nope. I feel like we should have our own original name.

I was saying it must be better than team bobs name.
• DATE: 1/14/2023, 6:30:28 PM
? Which name
Team Bob is Red Arrow's popular team name from last year.
• DATE: 1/14/2023, 5:13:25 PM
I mean, he used imageData...
• DATE: 1/14/2023, 5:11:24 PM
I responded a coupe of hours ago but it seems the comment was simply too small. 

Our team name must be better than Team Bob. Something funny, full of irony and silliness but at the same time, professional. 

We also need a logo. Any ideas?

I've started my project. I'm going to try something new that might not work.
• DATE: 1/14/2023, 11:41:30 AM
I also agree with ski. I think we should leave teams at 6 members due to the lack of activity and applications this year.

A couple tips to getting the recognition you deserve:

1. Be unique. Stop copying more popular devs in efforts to gain the popularity they earned. 
2. Program with simple, clean colors, graphics, and transitions. If it 
doesn't appease you then try harder.
3. Never give up. You didn't make it to CoC this year? Work harder, always give your best and try again next year.
• DATE: 1/12/2023, 9:15:01 PM
When you have CoC on the line you forget everything else exists _=p_

I'll finish it and everything else I've promised to others by Monday.

Is it just me or did:
1. The join page lost about 30 upvotes
2. The join page won't open
2. Everything in this thread from the last two days is missing?
The first comment I see is Paperwad's from 3 hours ago.

I also didn't get a notification about any of this (_Most likely because all the comments are deleted_) so I assume Henry and Polar might have no idea about this either

You're going around confusing people. I can assure you(>70%) that no active member on KA knows who I am.
• DATE: 1/9/2023, 6:25:01 PM
Hello, I've got a group of people hunting for my main ever since CoC started.

Quite possibly, but I can't remember you hunting for it. I guess you can just ignore the message. 

It definitely is _=D

lol_
• DATE: 1/9/2023, 3:06:08 PM

A couple corrections:
_"Astro said once she takes her two guesses he will go back to his main lol"_
I said if SMV guesses my main correctly then I'll go back to my main.

_"Primavera"_ - Spring in Spanish


@Mojo
Yea. I knew you on my main. 
The real question is if you're active enough to join CoC.

It doesn't matter which version between 'best' or 'better' you use. I prefer 'better'. DR's just trying to give you a different variety of options.
• DATE: 1/6/2023, 8:55:23 PM

It's not a resource intensive process. It's actually quite easy. I'll create a demo in a sec.

• DATE: 1/6/2023, 5:10:30 PM
True. 

I was talking about the style of the subpage. Is there a name for the 'function' you two created or is it just  normal mapped text?
• DATE: 1/6/2023, 4:21:59 PM
More notes =>
1. Looks amazing
2. The header image of the fire takes really long to load and ruins the webpage. I suggest finding a different fire image.

Maybe this image?

I shall take the initiative to spice up the game. At the same time, I shall fix any bugs.

Quick question:
Are the aircraft particles supposed to go on the wings or the back?
• DATE: 1/4/2023, 3:18:25 PM
@Polar
Your idea sounds interesting till you start thinking about it:

`Round 1: Pairs | 6 members | 3 entries | 2 per group
Round 2: Half of the team | 7-8 members? | 2 entries | 3-4 per group
Round 3: Whole Team | 9-10 members? | 1 entry | 4-5 per group`

So by the end we might end up with 8 or 10 members on each team. Which means there will be 40 or 50 participants (_If we have 5 captains_).
• DATE: 1/4/2023, 11:39:59 AM
The third option might cause more problems than solve them(My opinion). 

I vote for the snake draft. It worked perfectly last year.
• DATE: 1/4/2023, 11:35:10 AM
Yep. That's what you get when you run Typescirpt in an environment it's not suited for. You should never use ts in a HTML file. Especially not all in one file like this. 

All the code (Not by me) is meant to automatically compile ts into JS, so you don't have to use command-line. When you use it to run TypeScript on KA it's bound to have bugs. 

Not sure why it does that, but I believe it might be because we can still run JS in the script tags. At least the types (Main reason to use ts) still work.
• DATE: 1/4/2023, 11:25:35 AM
Yep _=D_
There's still a few rough areas, but regular TypeScript works perfectly fine.
• DATE: 1/3/2023, 9:11:10 PM
Hmmm.....How can I better explain this. Let's say I made an insane 3D game but it's really really laggy. Now there's two things I could do:

1. Go through my code and rewrite important parts like using the "better" or "best" keypressed method. _Just do it right in the first place_

2. Invite someone else to collab with me to reduce the bugs and lag. _Oh wait. I can't cuz my codes too messy_

These tips by DR are here to help you improve as a programmer. As always you can read others comments and gain others opinions.

Sorry, I was so busy with other stuff I completely forgot about this. It looks amazing. Seems like you finished the graphic. What should I get started on?
• DATE: 1/3/2023, 7:16:20 PM
Seems excessive. Why not use something that already exists:
`TypeScript Compile`

I used this program last year for a private project where I needed to compile ts into JS. All I had to do was find it's CDN. Can someone tell me if they can see the "Hello World" message? If so then we've got Typescript. 
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/4988936014839808

I can already guarantee that something with the proposed solution above might not work correctly on KA. Till then I'll be creating my own ts compiler to work on KA.
• DATE: 1/3/2023, 5:45:18 PM

I completely agree with polar. 

@Polar
TypeScript and React are amazing. 
Have you heard of Next.js?

To clear things up. You can use any language. Even SQL. It's just a matter of winning. . .
• DATE: 1/3/2023, 11:38:27 AM
#17

Avoid writing excessive comments. Your code will become messier and harder to understand. Your intensions to help the user understand your code is great but they'll get more lost and usually avoid looking at code if it has a lot of comments. 

Why? Just because our brains structured that way:
_A lot of comments => important/tricky stuff => it must be hard_
• DATE: 1/3/2023, 6:39:02 AM
Ka only allows external scripts from the following:
`
*.kastatic.org
*.khanacademy.org
cdn.rawgit.com 
rawgit.com 
ajax.googleapis.com 
cdn.jsdelivr.net 
cdnjs.cloudflare.com
`

So you'll always need a CDN from one of the following sources above. As polar as said is most likely for security reasons.

• DATE: 1/2/2023, 8:05:37 PM
@Horizon
Well to web devs CSS is a pain. Nothing ever works right and people tend to cry alot. So programmers made libraries to make CSS easier. Now on KA(_The site that regulates everything_) most libraries don't work. So Quinn & Leaf built KA-SASS and I found a Tailwind cdn. Quinn went around telling everyone while I said nothing. Problem solved _=D_
• DATE: 1/2/2023, 7:47:25 PM

CSS is a pain. 
Use SASS, Tailwind or some other CSS library KA allows.

ski's info is up there ^^^

Mine:
_Astro is a full stack developer experienced in various languages who spends his time on KA helping others and coming up with project ideas he can never finish. He loves participating in competitions and works best under pressure.

It surely is. We have tomorrow, right? Here are a couple of things I still wanna add:
- Infinite ground
- Better "Learn" page with multiple scenes
- Maybe a shop or score feature...

One thing I noticed with your physic system is that it breaks when it comes to horizontal and vertical lines. It can't detect them.

`if (Math.random() > 0.05) {
    sign(144, 29, 0.4, 0.4, 7);
}`
Feel free to mess around

Hello,
I remember this from last year. I'd love to be a captain this year. I'll have plenty of free time throughout Jan-Feb so I should be fairly active. Thanks for the offer _=D_

Do you want me to report anywhere?

You found my secret workspace _=O_

Hmmm....How would I explain this?
Basically: 
```
try {
_//You run your code in the try inside_
} catch (error) {
_// If a bug or problem in the program occurs you catch it 
//And do what ever you want with it here. 
//It's a debugging tool that's better than o noes_
}

Ah. frameRate(max) runs on the max frameRate the computer can handle. For example, Chromebooks cap out at 250. It's meant to prevent crashing by staying right under the max limit. Your computer shouldn't crash with that line of code  _=p_

My bad _=(_

Easily. It only takes me like 10 extra lines of code to make it 2 player. Do you want me to make it two player?

The ground looks great! Not sure if we can use the background. But it's a great idea _=D_
• DATE: 12/13/2022, 6:40:02 PM
No problem _=D_
I suggest you change line 20 to:

• DATE: 12/12/2022, 6:12:56 PM
Yes. I'd like you to follow a pattern:

1. Make it the shape of a square. It doesn't need arms or legs. 
2. Keep it simple. Just a face is enough or if you'd like to go the extra mile, add a body still inside the square.

The size of the square doesn't matter. I can ajust it later.

Or should we have the player control the car and do vice versa? What do you think?
• DATE: 12/10/2022, 2:47:03 PM
Made an entry thread. You can find it in the recent tab. We should turn the two groups in to one-_ish_ group.

Template literals can contain strings.

What you did is called tagged template literals. 
Without `()` all you can do is determine the values passed.
With `()` you can pass an argument.

Me and a friend of mine has a huge project in the works off-KA and it broke. I was blamed as I used for-loops causing the program to slowdown.  I had to go through and rewrite about 50 for-loops. Then he saw my AoC code and made me rewrite those loops too (thankfully I only had 3-4). 

Turns out it wasn't my fault at all. He used an eval function in a place he shouldn't have.

_Side note: Always use .forEach when possible, unless your names Astro and your too lazy todo anything right_
• DATE: 12/7/2022, 7:33:37 PM
Oh, we're all active. Just don't know what to say....

I'm done with the Cybertruck (On the tesla coil project)

I haven't done the wheels yet. We can use placeholders for now till we get the physics working. 

A particle class with physics sounds cool but It'd make the game too laggy. You could start the enemy class. I'll make the "lesson" half of the tesla coil project.

C++ is a pain. Have you tried C#?

Out of all the JavaScript libraries out there I only use Typescript & React. Learning all the libraries out there in my opinion is a waste of time.

Liam subbing doesn't prove that you'll make it into the team. It's all based on the team captain's picking. Liam and Cowboy only make the final approval and interfere if two captains pick the same people they'd like on their team =(

I don't think Liam's even subbed to me _=p_

Captains would usually go for a solid, skilled team, which would usually look like this:

_- 1/2 Logic Devs

If a member of the team is inactive(After the picking or anytime during the contest) the team can draft other members from the signup list or pick any active member they'd like. Every member counts. It's just another reason the competition's so competitive.

If an inactive member comes back they'll be part of the team again. They don't get kicked out _=D_

I probably won't be team captain as Astro. The accounts only 4 months old and has no solid evidence of my skill level. But then Kevin did become captain last year. 
_Maybe I could get a position with my main_....

@Cardstock
Signing up quickly won't matter. It's all based on opinion and skill. If the host (Liam & Cowboy) picks you, you're a captain otherwise you wait till you get picked into a team.

@pro gong player (_I believe that's your nickname?_)
It's the only reason most of us come back...
Didn't every team draft a bunch of peeps? Red Arrow was just the luckiest.  
Also, I did say 6-8 members per team.

Exactly, bigger annual competitions take over as they gained traction over years. Same way we legends like Green Ghost will always be known.

Don't stop though. One day, other competitions will gain the same kind of traction, as long as they're creative. 
_Notice how every new competition has similar challenges to the older ones_

• DATE: 11/28/2022, 6:38:06 PM
I was going to ask why you started this at the same time CoC starts.....

Coc is a competition were the hosts pick 5-6 different popular team captains to run teams. Then those captains will go through the join thread and pick coders 6-8 they'd like on their team. Some of the previous captains were:
- Red Arrow
-  IA
- Cyberwolf 
- Corin Fist
- Kevin W
- Ace
- Liam K
- LTCD
- Magma
- Littewhinging
- Akbaba
- AquaA217

This picking results in only the best of the best programmers on KA getting accepted making the contest super competitive and fun for viewers and programmers. 
_Only reason legends *some* are still around/come back_

Not sure how it'll work this year with the lack of activity.

@Fireball
I'm guessing the powerups is the speed object? circCirc won't work as you haven't defined the radius or in this case size. Add `this.size = #` to your constructor. 

@Lemon
Cap seems to be active. I'm busy right now but here's how the AI should work:

1. Remove the player form the target/attack function
2. Use circle collisions to detect when another enemy is nearby within a certain radius. 
3. Modify the attack function to target that nearby object. (Do the same for water, and powerups)

Give that a try. If it doesn't work, I'll try to guide/fix it. Or you can wait a week and I'll be free to finish it...

• DATE: 11/25/2022, 11:43:13 AM
Well....

I was testing the reliability of color collisions and I found out that color collisions are heavily depend on the frameRate. 

So my reasons to use color collisions are
1. The player isn't an object
2. This is a small minigame
3. The game runs on a steady frameRate and the collisions are simple so they shouldn't be a problem. 
4. The games called _color_ code

They're terrible reasons and you'll never see me using color collisions for a game. I just wanted to try something new _=p_

_Note to anyone else reading this: 
NEVER use color collisions when making a game. There are wayy better and more efficient ways to detect collisions_
• DATE: 11/24/2022, 1:51:34 PM
That could work. The plasma effect runs at a solid 60 when you remove the max frameRate. 

A collab would be fun! We'd get to learn new things from each other. I've got school too, so I'm less active on weekdays, but we have a whole month to finish this. 

For the car, it'd be funny if the pickup truck was the tesla cybertruck with a strapped tesla coil on the back. Ground collisions could be done with noise, or line-circle. The physics might be tricky depending on the collision method.

It's a great idea. I was going to teach them how/uses of a tesla coil. This is a perfect way to do so. I like the idea of upgrade with 
 my favorite being: more coils => bigger range or damage

The enemies could be related to electric conductors that attract the plasma or just common flammable things _=p_

The guidelines for subpages are really loose.

I agree with Promise in the first half of her message.  

What I meant to say is that KA doesn't mind if you post someone else's project and the user truly deserves it. But posting _other_ users projects daily is against the guidelines as it defeats the purpose of a subpage. Doing so will probably draw the attention of a guardian.

• DATE: 11/17/2022, 4:28:15 PM

• DATE: 11/17/2022, 4:25:53 PM
When we(_I've been on KA for 5 years I think (2016-2017). This is an alt_) say the hotlist is dying we mean the gradual decrease for popularity, quality and quantity.

1. Popularity: KA used to average about 5,000 votes a day. Nowadays KA's average vote per day is about 600. It heavily decreased after august 2021(_KA security update_) when child/student accounts were no longer allowed to vote and users needed verify emails.

2. Quality: It's pretty self-explatory. More memes, less games/graphics

3. Quantity: KA used to be competitive. There was so many amazing projects. Most underrated because of the shear amount of competition. You'd need a huge sum of votes to reach the top row and getting to the top made you feel as sense of pride (_We've all experienced that time when we first started out_)

Hopefully, one day the great "revival" will revive KA _=p_

I don't think you've ever created an API before. You can setup an API but you'd need to test the subject or Database to run/make it. Your method would require the dev team to do one of 3 things. 

1. Create/setup a whole new "huge" database just to test their API. Huge because the API don't only consist of KA's CS commiuty but every lesson/viedo/program on KA
2. If they make a APi and shut down KA for a day or so they'd be shutting down KA every other day for at least a couple hours. They'd also get no user feedback about bugs.
3. Follow your method and blindly make an API which no man can ever truly do. This would result in more bugs that KA's facing right now and us stuck with these bugs for long periods of time (_weeks_)

It's annoying but we should be grateful that KA's moving to GraphQL. It'll open a lot of possible opportunitys for us in the future.
• DATE: 11/17/2022, 3:29:24 PM

You can use willard.fun on a school Chromebook. It's school safe (_As long as you don't play minekhan_). It's just a searchable database with KA's programs.

BTW I believe this is what Fourth Moons talking about:
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/4973618010210304
• DATE: 11/16/2022, 7:17:50 PM
_"put on almost all your webpage"_

If you want to build a fullscreen webpage you can make one-off KA on a different platform. KA's small editor gives you a challenge. For example a web dev like me has built a lot websites off KA. It's easy. But making one on KA is hard. You're limited to a lot of resources and sizes. If a dev (Voldy) can make a good-looking website within the following limitations, then she's a true web dev. You learn a lot about precision and perfection when others can see the smaller flaws that would get hidden on a fullpage website. 

Nonetheless, this is still a great tutorial and it'll help a lot of new programmers.

Bugs like this are very common. It's normal for small bugs to occur when your transitioning to a new API. There are alway two ways to move averything. 

1. Move parts bit by bit in which many bugs can occur. 
2. Shut down the API till the transition is done. There won't be any bugs, but KA would be out of service for 1-2 months. Thankfully, KA hasn't done this
• DATE: 11/15/2022, 7:27:04 PM

Hey Cowboy,

Levi, Henry, me (_I'm a alt_), ski and Paperwad have been on KA for over 2 years with Polar having about one year of KA community experience. Just a random thing I'd let you know about _=p_

Here's what remained of my list after round one of the drafting:

[Removed]
• DATE: 1/12/2023, 6:11:50 PM
Well, we all know the classic trick:

_chicken => fox => chicken => grain => chicken_

But here's a better idea. The question never told you what form or state the objects have to be in:

_Feed the grain to the chicken
Feed the chicken to the fox
Take the fox over_

That way you only have to make one trip and you theoretically carryed every object at once.

You finished _=D_

Now time for feedback:
- I think an image parallax on the news page would look cool
- Fullscreen's broken (I don't think you even need it)
- Use nth-child and make the projects evens and odds rotate in opposite directions
- Links to the users profiles on the member's page

Oh and change me to advanced, I'm not a Beginner _lol_

I personally hate making fullscreen webpages for KA. If you really want to make a full-screen webpage there are better places. KA has boundaries - _the main reason I'm still here_. They really put your skills to the test. Can you fit everything you want to say into a small 600x600 size webpage?

Your collision checks if the y position is greater or less than the platforms y position not if it's  colliding with the platform. Try using rect-rect collisions. 
```
function Rect_Rect_Col(r,r2){
    var x1 = r.x, y1 = r.y, w1 = r.w, h1 = r.h;
    var x2 = r2.x, y2 = r2.y, w2 = r2.w, h2 = r2.h;

    return x1 < x2 + w2 &&
    x1 + w1 > x2 &&
    y1 < y2 + h2 &&
    y1 + h1 > y2;
}
```
If you need help implementing this you can ask =)

```The `translate();` function will do the moving and your `rect();` and other functions won't have all sorts of letters in them making it easier to animate and more efficient.

Hi there,

I don't really understand your question. Maybe this will help:
```
//A loop
for (var i = 0; i < positions.length; i++) {

    //Stores the poisiton iteration as a variable
    var position = positions[i];

    //Calls the stored x and y positions of the iteration of the positions object
    ellipse(position.x, position.y, 100, 100);
}
```
If this doesn't make sense, feel free to ask more questions.

Hi,

KA no longer teaches python courses, but you can still find them on KA's YouTube channel.

KA hasn't removed any API or moved it. Otherwise, KA would stop working. They've transitioned to using GraphQL. This caused ther old API endpoints to be wiped stopping old API programs. Older KA users have known this for months now. Even Lewis has talked about KA adding new endpoints. Not sure when it'll happen. 

Doesn't make sense? Think of it like this:
_You need data from another room and the only way to access it is by pulling a string. Now imagine the data's been moved to a better bigger room. But there are no strings attached to the new data. The old rooms are now empty and you can't use the new data._

Well when someone comments you can't see them, but they show up in your notifications. This means the API still works. All I did was access the “working” API. _Click on a T&T to see all its comments_

A triangle function works like this:
```triangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3);```
Basically, these are three coordinate pairs.
`(x1,y1) (x2,y2) (x3,y3)`
Each pair is a conner of the triangle, so to create a triangle plot the three coordinates of each of the corners of the triangle you want to make.

A triangle function looks like this:
`
triangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3);
`
And you can do other shapes too. If you scroll down on a program and look above _Created by: pamela_ you'll see a documentation tab where you can find all sorts of functions.

Yes. If you can add why can't you subtract? 

If we had:
```
var i = 100;
```
and we used `i++;` the variable would increase. If we did `i--;` the variable would decrease.

A triangle function works like this:
triangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3);

Basically, these are three coordinate pairs.
(x1,y1) (x2,y2) (x3,y3)
Each pair is a conner of the triangle, so to create a triangle plot the three coordinates of each of the conners of the triangle you want to make.

```
strokeCap(ROUND);/*"Default"*/
strokeCap(SQUARE);
strokeCap(PROJECT);

Pamela decelerated `faceposition` as an object before using the function `drawWinston()` in the for loop.

A computer reads line by line, so it knew about the object before the used in the function. If you wanted though you could put the array of positions before the `drawWinston()` function.

Each KA user/account has it's own kaid or in other words an ID. It comes in handy if I want to use API and want to see your profile...

For example, this is your kaid:
```
kaid_619907275813251470386751
```
So If I search:
https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_619907275813251470386751

It takes me to your profile. 

I've used kaids to do the same thing. Try clicking on one of the names on the member's page.

Try:
```image(getImage("creatures/Winston"), 200, 200, 50, 50);```
If you're trying to use getImage() outside of image(), you need to declare it as a variable like this:
```var winston = getImage("creatures/Winston");

image(winston, 200, 200, 50, 50);```
