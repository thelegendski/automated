For my purposes, Tensorflow.js should not need write permissions; furthermore, the current error I am getting is a CSP/CORS error in the console.\n\nThe main issue I am having is that `tf.loadGraphModel` and `tf.loadLayersModel` do not accept the JSON object itself but rather the URL that directs the function to the JSON object. However if the model is stored in `localstorage` or `indexeddb`, the model has to be stored in a particular format that I do not know.

The solution, in theory, would be assigning the object to a variable, using `JSON.stringify`, and then sending that string to Tensorflow.js.

It is simply clickbait. Sure you can name a project whatever you like, and I get to criticize the project's name however I like. You're free to say whatever you like, and so am I. :) You can ignore what I have to say if you would like, and I don't mean any harm by it. I simply wish for the other users in the KACP to be well-informed. To be fair, a plethora of gaming franchises use the term AI to truly mean CPU as the computer's algorithm doesn't hold any intelligence.\n\nSpeaking of ChatGPT, here's a very, very simple definition of artificial intelligence: \"Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, is like having a smart robot friend that can think and learn just like humans do. It's a special kind of technology that helps computers do things that usually only people can do. AI can understand and talk to us, play games, solve problems, and even help with important tasks like finding information or driving cars. It's a bit like having a really clever helper that can do things on its own without needing constant instructions.\" Artificial intelligence implies that the program learns and makes decisions based on past knowledge and completely independent from the programmer. In this case, you are force-feeding the data to the chatbot, and the chatbot cannot respond on its own and is completely dependent on the programmer; thus, this is not artificial intelligence, and I find it misleading to label it as such. However, you label it however you like, ;P."},{"date":"2023-06-17T17:01:01.5799Z","msg":"You would save so much time if you gave up on trying to defend your use of converter.
