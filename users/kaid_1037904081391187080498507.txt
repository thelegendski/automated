postin' here to not spam everyone else.

there are two reasons why your join code errored out on my end.
first, i had an xss attack from another user an' so you can only use alphanumeric values an' spaces in namez [which don't do anythin' since i access the name through the API].
second, your team name has to be ninjaz, astronomers, or leviathans. "Ex-Host" has been added in, so you just need to fix your name to "Liam K"

edit: fixed the script on my end so you should show up w/o needin' to repost/edit.

this should've been sent to you yesterday, but it seems to have been hidden.

i've sent you the link to the project on GitHub, but lmk if that one doesn't work either.
? DATE: 3/7/2023, 8:44:47?AM
oh yeah, lol.

it'll get fixed in `1.8.10` which will be released in the near future. revert back to version `1.8.4` for now.

if ski.js was fully finished, i would def agree that it is a terrible library.
ski.js is the best overall if we consider the costs an' benefits of all libraries. it's easier for development, basically the most efficient unless you're PixiJS an' use WebGL to draw the canvas, but lacks the sheer number of features that other libraries offer. if you're lookin' for a library packed with every feature, don't look to ski.js. if you're lookin' for a library that has the basic functions an' gets the job done, that's what ski.js is for.
? DATE: 3/6/2023, 11:09:26?AM
the Guardians will let it fly as long as you only use it for `mouseScrolled`. if you're still concerned just move to the web environment lol.
? DATE: 3/6/2023, 9:57:18?AM
eh, it's got a long ways to go to bein' a finished product.

i could load all of the images on an `OffscreenCanvas` an' cache the `ImageData`, but wouldn't that be less efficient if i wanted a loadin' screen on the current canvas? i think i misunderstood you.
the function `set` creates an `OffscreenCanvas` on line 1092 that ski.js uses to draw.

it certainly does. lol, yeah, i do. the reason why i didn't overlay HTML for the HUD here is that i was on a time crunch an' didn't see the need to add an extra movin' part by interactin' with the DOM. is there a particular advantage of usin' the DOM over the canvas?

wow, thank you, :D. means a lot to me comin' from you.
uh, it needs way more comments to be well-commented, but the first few hundred lines are okay.
? DATE: 3/6/2023, 9:52:18?AM
that i'll see if i can fix. the issue has been that KA forces me to check the events for the entire DOM instead of just the canvas. i think someone else has a fix for that, so i'll see what i can do.

that is a simple fix, but i personally like it which is why it has persisted across all versions. you can disable it with one line.
`canvas.onscoll = () => {}`

that's an easy fix. i'll change that in a pinch. i think you should be able to change `skiJSData`.

ski.js never claims to be the best canvas library for comprehensiveness an' dev experience. it isn't production-stable, so i think it's slightly unfair to treat it as a finished product. ski.js is the best canvas library overall when you consider efficiency, comprehensiveness, an' dev experience. if you want more comprehension an' mediocre performance, join the p5.js train. if you want crazy efficiency [much faster than ski.js] but a worse dev experience an' completely different from the PJS you're used to, PixiJS is the way to go.

knowledge only matters if you can apply it.

sure someone scores a perfect score on a test, but when the curriculum is useless what good is the test score?

sure i'm probs in the top 10 perhaps top 5 coderz on KA rn knowledge-wise, but i can't do the simple stuff like creatin' a new script element that sets the values of other elements in the DOM.

what do i have to brag 'bout besides havin' a head filled with useless information?
? DATE: 3/3/2023, 2:21:42?PM
paste this into a new webpage in a script with `type` set to `module`. if it doesn't work, then you've blocked pop-ups as it should work.

if `window.fullscreen` exists [is truthy], set it to a constant `run`. else, run the fullscreen script where the new window has `window.fullscreen` set to a truthy value.

```
const run = window.fullscreen || (function () {
    const win = window.open()
    win.document.open()
    win.document.write("<!DOCTYPE html>" + document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].outerHTML)
    win.document.close()
    win.fullscreen = true

he's already messaged me privately on it.

it's portin' to KA that's the issue. the entire thin' is done off-KA on another platform (CodeHS) due to KA hatin' CoffeeScript (forces me to save an' reload everytime a change is made). the issue is that CodeHS has my full name on it, an' i can't exactly share that link. there's a link i can share that shows the finished product w/o the code which i will produce when i release. the current issue is portin' to KA. it's all set up, but the issue with Liftoff's compiler was that it sent arguments passed into `fmt.Println` to the console an' i modified it to send to an element instead so the user didn't need to open the console (or in the case they didn't have access to the console). KA must hate the technique i used or it doesn't work in the sandbox idk which. if Liftoff could work on that, i _think_ that's it.

furthermore, if you know how to use the modern syntax, you wouldn't be in the PJS environment.

i _think_ i can do it live.

huh, i'll try my hand at it.

been tryin' to figure out what `Program.settings` an' `Program.runTests` do. has anyone ever figured it out? KA's source code on GitHub doesn't provide any documentation, but it claims that there are settin's that programs can modify.
? DATE: 2/26/2023, 8:58:49?PM
beyond possible, is it reasonable to implement? the next step beyond doin' what _can_ be done is convincin' others it _should_ be done.

i think my first endeavor of smth similar would be an implementation of CoffeeScript, but the compile times aren't pretty.

in reference to your Open Problems project, is there a particular reason why the `SharedWorkers` API is particularly difficult to implement in PJS?
? DATE: 2/26/2023, 8:34:33?PM
`eval` is stupid. a `script` tag isn't, but i see your point.

beyond provin' that the KA devs don't prioritize this community in the slightest regardless of the work involved, how difficult would it be to make the editor compatible with p5.js? technically you're manipulatin' the DOM which should arguably [in the perspective of the Guardians an' their moderation] only be done in the web environment, so PixiJS, Paper.js, ski.js, etc. are all possibilities for the editor since you essentially stripped it down to its bones in the respect of the compiler.

@SP
how does the council know where you've gotten your code? it's one thin' to plagiarize code off KA since you can find it through reasonable means [how many others programs were created in an outdated language], but what if a more experienced programmer copies large portions of their program from ChatGPT? it's more than capable of producin' algorithms that could take days to complete an' programmin' in a webpage rather than PJS would make ChatGPT even more powerful. as some of the council members are Guardians, they should know that the members of the KA community aren't always honest an' simply relyin' upon their morals isn't the best idea.

rules are fine an' all, but they are only feared when they are enforced. i find this proposition of the council not only confusin' as Bob has stated but also impossible to enforce. there's no tool available on the internet that can accurately [key word] detect whether code was generated by an AI.

"Oh pixel is the size of your pixels."
oh, that makes sense. as in i didn't know what my own code did an' you explained it to me.

"So there was no way around it :P"
i thought this was your response to the print.js fix, so my natural inclination was that KA's editor is garbage after a recent update as i didn't have to reload the page every time for the script to load for 1.8.3 but now i do.

kernelz, :DDDD!

oh yeah!

blur is easily the slowest lol.
GPU faster than CPU, so why calculate on the CPU, o.O.
? DATE: 2/24/2023, 6:12:45?AM
yup, =/. unless you use the same canvas for every filter an' naturally resettin' the `canvas` width an' height resets the `canvas` itself, :o.

me have smol brain. me not know what `uv` coords are. me copy from WebGLFundamentals an' then play with it.

```
vec2 pixel = vec2(1.0, 1.0) / size;
```
? DATE: 2/23/2023, 7:59:01?PM
i have no clue how you would make it faster. i'm on a literal potato. it grew from the ground an' i plugged a couple wires in an' bam, a "Chromebook" they call it.

yeah, you'll have to use `Promise`s for that.

i think it's the initial setup behind the canvas API 'cuz they might optimize it for just the 2D context an' forget WebGL? mine is slower than yours 'cuz i suck at WebGL an' there's probs a bunch of performance tips that i'm missin' out on [that i'd love to hear if anyone has 'em] but hey, it works, :D.
? DATE: 2/23/2023, 7:55:59?PM
uh, there's this new weird KA bug where i have to save an' reload for the script to run, o.O. what the heck? 1.8.6 works [it used `var`, :p]

`print.js` + major changes to `main.js` = version skip, :p.

```texture2D(Sampler, texture + pixel * vec2(-1.0, -1.0)```
grabs the pixel to the upper left of the current pixel in the texture.
? DATE: 2/23/2023, 7:45:20?PM
it's not ideal, but filters are rlly only used for cached images/canvases.

my deepest apologies. i presumed you intended this to be a competition rather than for the sport of programmin', :).

i was entirely unaware of this fact 'fore you mentioned it, :). i'm grateful that you have an' will work on implementin' `transform` an' `setTransform` to perform any transformations.

a documentation is planned, but obviously not made yet.

that should be an easy fix. i'll add that in the next release, ;p.

ah, alr, :p.

VEXCESS is on GitHub an' Tuan provided an example of it. Polar's is here [note that Polar took most of the difficult pieces of his library from ski.js].
`_*https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/5081035719622656*_`

you've already beat Drawlite.js by miles.

@Tuan
VEXCESS' library is absolutely terrible. suffers from the same rookie mistakes as everyone else's library. the `draw` function is done in the most inefficient manner. only Aliquis out of those 58+ programmers could beat ski.js. additionally, VEXCESS decided that those 58+ others need no credit (line 7 `All other code written by Vexcess`).

from the fact that you boast with an immature ego, i take it that you are the banned VEXCESS. regardless, realize that no one on KA will beat ski.js with just a couple weeks.

too tired to respond rn, but everythin' sounds (an' looks, :D) good. i'll figure out #2. not sure how #1 will work [it'll just be text], so we'll figure it out when we get there.

there will only be one large level, so we'll see how i come up with the riddlez.

done.
? DATE: 2/11/2023, 2:00:26?PM
you might press space || enter an' a panel pops up for you to type the numbers in based on how many colored dots you counted on the wallz.

correction, i have no clue why i phrased it like that.
here's my dilemna, i want different surfaces that aren't just rectangular; hence, the line-circle physix on my wip. what my head can't get 'round is how i'm gon' make the blox into irregular shapes. i've thought of maskin' the blox, but i have no clue if that will work or not. first, i'd have to mask the brix, but the part that i can't get my mind 'round is how where i'd position the image since everythin' is centered. lmk if you can think of smth else. might just create a new class called `Shape`, construct all the shapez [irregular blox] in a list called `shapez`. then when i load the level, the last bit will be cachin' all of the shape graphix. would have to place each shape by hand with RegEx parser, but that just might work.

considerin' it's an underground prison, go for a darker blue color on the brix.

if you have the time, could you make a darker colored brick background? i'll use it for a parallax feel.

sounds good, :D!
yeah, it need to at least be square.

edit: the comment in the code is so true lol. i hate the new comment update, >:(.
? DATE: 2/11/2023, 1:51:52?PM
i could, an' no, it isn't there yet. it's a super simple function that i was too lazy to implement in the first round of ski.js 9 months ago an' forgot 'bout it since.

i might have. i usually delete useless workspaces so i can find the relevant stuff, but i don't recall doin' it recently.
? DATE: 2/11/2023, 12:25:54?PM
ah, that might be due to the `blur` filter on the svg.
? DATE: 2/11/2023, 8:36:47?AM
i'm on a potato an' it didn't lag for the minute i used it.

one thin' that might be givin' you trouble is that KA doesn't reset `addEventListener` so you have to set `on[event]` instead if you don't want it to crash as you edit, but that's only for dev. 

i have no clue why it would be laggin' on your end. SVG is faster than canvas, an' the logic seems pretty straightforward. maybe cache all references to elements at the beginnin' of the script tag?
? DATE: 2/10/2023, 7:31:29?PM
smth that just came to mind.
first, how do control panels work?
second, i need the block graphix. they should have a pattern not determined by `random` so i can string 'em together in a long line, :). i need to do some magic ski stuff to make 'em work with my current level planz, so we'll see how that goes.
third, i think you're nearin' the end of what you need to do. i'll probs need your help with level creation once i get there, but in the meantime, could you spice up the how an' leaderboard scenez with some animation?

looks great!

fixed in my spin-off [same as 'fore].

thanks! they won't if they can get away with doin' what they're doin' now, unless they have the drive to learn more, :).

only thin' i forgot to mention is that peepz are startin' to abuse is `randomSeed` an' ski.js is not gon' implement `randomSeed` as that is WAY too computationally expensive. new code is from lines 2191 to 2224.

slightly 'bove.

don't `lerp` the color, but part of the shape instead [width, height, etc].

:D

it actually isn't, xD. Astro must've voted an' then called on some friends lol.

that's better, :).

umm, in my world, yes lol.
you _can_. you _shouldn't_. i'll make the iconz if you want me to, but the pre-built icons are like makin' a game out of emojis. it just doesn't look right.
? DATE: 2/7/2023, 5:15:41?PM
lookin' great, :D!

eh, simple animations would be better. cop lights might be better for a scene transition.

looks good!

not me.


could you make the iconz/text in the buttonz bigger [fill 70-80% of the space in the button]?

edit: just double checkin', but you weren't gon' leave the iconz for the buttonz as text, right?

can confirm that FF is subbed to this thread.

@ALL JUDGEZ
if y'all could post your breakdown on the individual programs that you judge, i'm sure all the contestants would appreciate it, :). you'll be scorin' each entry with the breakdown anyways (creativity, complexity, output, design, etc.), so it should be a trivial matter to post it in a new t&t.

if you're havin' a rlly good day, short explanations for the score like Liam had posted in the news thread would be tremendously appreciated, :D.
? DATE: 2/7/2023, 9:56:14?AM
just a quick update.
we obviously don't have Samwise anymore, an' we don't have HS either.
they've been replaced by Promise [which you already know].
i think you left Liftoff out of my team on the homepage lol. i think i didn't mention which memberz have left so you naturally assumed Liftoff was one of 'em?

? DATE: 2/7/2023, 8:28:11?AM
smth like that yeah. a few kinx are missin' in your logic, but i can work 'em out.

the new menu runs at an 20fps. not sure if you're still workin' on it, but all scenes need to run at 60fps, ;p. you should just be able to cache the menu background in an image an' then draw the background to restore the fps. [i mean i got a 5000+x2000+ image to run in the background at 60fps, so i think it would restore the frame rate]
? DATE: 2/7/2023, 6:21:34?AM
if the arms are made from a number of complex shapes used for detail an' structure, then they will need to be cached as an image. otherwise, they won't.

control panels to open doorz, knock out guards with weapons they drop, an' any other functionality you can think of.

? DATE: 2/5/2023, 7:38:28?PM
it is fixed here. didn't want to tamper with the original in case it disqualified the entry.
`_*https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/5768518536839168*_`
? DATE: 2/5/2023, 7:23:15?PM
rlly? i'm surprised. i expected to be deducted heavily for messy code/lack of commentin'.

in theory, it is. the biggest issue is that other enemies are obstacle an' they are mobile. additionally, the whole map isn't set up in a grid form, so literally any common pathfindin' algorithm is thrown out the window. a freeform pathfindin' algorithm is the only option, but existence, much less implementation, of such an algorithm that is widely available to the public is none.

biggest issue there is performance, but that was certainly a possibility i overlooked. i'll look into that for the release.

i fixed that bug after i submitted the entry. just needed to move where the collisions took place, but your idea would've worked as well.
? DATE: 2/5/2023, 7:00:58?PM
i fixed all of the issues with a few fixes.

buttons:
your issue is that the collision function is set to the wrong mode. you're usin' `rectMode(CORNER)` when the button is drawn, so the collision function needs to know the same. add the argument `0` after the other arguments in the collision function. you'll need an `else` statement afterwards to change the color back, but it works like a charm, ;p.

images:
not sure what went wrong with `draw` or the characters. uncomment the `load` function an' use the code below. lmk if you don't understand any of it or it still doesn't work.
```
let scene = 'load'
draw = () => {
    switch(scene){
        case 'load':
            load(graphics, 'hello')
        break
        case 'hello':
            menuScene()
    }
}
```
? DATE: 2/5/2023, 6:52:29?PM
i'll be sure too, ;p.

so, the first one takes a point `{x, y}` an' checks to see if is in a rectangle `{x, y, width, height}`. the second does the same except for a circle `{x, y, size}`. they both return true if the point is inside of the shape. the first one just does a bunch of boolean checks, the second uses the distance formula to determine the distance of the point from the center of the circle relative to its size.

are you doin' that to annoy me with a fangirl approach? if so, it's very, very effective.
? DATE: 2/4/2023, 7:44:55?PM
haven't tried to work on it yet, ;p.
? DATE: 2/4/2023, 11:24:02?AM
not done debuggin', ;-;.

lol, i'd rather you ask for the parts that aren't workin'/you don't understand, ;p.
? DATE: 2/3/2023, 5:43:39?PM
oh, wow. didn't even know that happened. my bad there.

so, the short answer is not rlly. the way `randomSeed` works forces me to basically reinvent `random` in a rather inefficient manner an' with math i don't understand. i could make p5.js' code better, but it's a huge class rather than one function, so idk how that would go.

i have some recommendations for replacements.
? DATE: 2/3/2023, 4:52:47?PM
alr, which KA program would have the highest score?

very. keeps stalkers at bay.
? DATE: 2/3/2023, 4:51:23?PM
you can have the ellipses swing with the wind usin' trig an' `frameCount`, or even better `lerp` an' `random`, but ski.js functions exactly like PJS in this respect.

yup.

provide a program that deserves a 10 then.

my teammates an' i do have a homepage, but we don't rlly use it. all chat is in a private repo on GitHub.
? DATE: 2/3/2023, 4:31:48?PM
the simplest, best way is to simply cache the image with `get` an' then display, ;p. 
`randomSeed` actually wouldn't help you there. that's only for when the program reloads, but it still generates random values every frame.
? DATE: 2/2/2023, 6:05:55?PM

? DATE: 2/2/2023, 8:19:07?AM
all 3 rebuttals an' the original program you spun off of 'fore it was hidden.
i could argue 'bout this for days tbh, but in reality, it doesn't accomplish anythin' if others don't see it.

you can't stop voters. there's too many of 'em an' you can't contact 'em all to address the situation. even if you did, the next day you'd have 10 more voterz to address. rather than address votin', you'd need to address the creation of the projex. i only addressed the situation when i knew that the two creatorz were familiar with the community an' its expectations.

SMV linked that one an' her rebuttal, but i hadn't seen this program yet, ;p.
? DATE: 2/2/2023, 8:09:24?AM
we're on GitHub in a private repo, ;p. if you have GitHub, i can send SMV your username to add you to the repo. if not, are you able to create a GitHub acc? i can make arrangements if you can't.

pretty much. HSstudent16, Samwise, an' TML. not necessarily due to inactivity, but that's not too important.

oh an' if you ever wonder why i have this many backups, it's due to the fact that my school chromebook keeps crashin' in dev (like the whole screen turns black for a full 10 seconds 'fore it goes back to normal an' lags out), so i keep a bunch of backups whenever that happens so i don't lose progress.

as to your note in the other thread on IPs, i can't find anywhere that GitHub states that it shows IPs to others.

every website you visit sees your IP [that includes GitHub] an' GitHub sees your general geolocation based on your IP [like every other website can; most certainly Google] [such as you live somewhere near Richmond in my case, but i live miles upon miles away in a suburb]. GitHub doesn't share location [SMV can testify lol] or IP based.

all info stated 'bove can be found in GitHub's privacy statement in case you wish to know deeper specifics or are still concerned. if they did share IPs, the 100 million+ devs on GitHub might not be there since they know much better than any of us the danger of publicly displayin' your IP address.

TL;DR GitHub doesn't show any info related to your IP includin' geolocation to others [unless you decide to], but stores it privately for GitHub's purposes.

if you still don't feel comfortable usin' GitHub, i'll see if there's another method we can communicate on KA w/o others seein'.

@Doglover
due to the time crunch, SP's activity [our other new member, :D], an' round 2 bein' right 'round the corner [starts tomorrow], your entry will be in PJS.

i'll be creatin' a quick course for SP to explain the new syntax/features for round 3, so all entries afterwards should be in the web environment which doesn't mean much for you but wanted to give you a heads up, ;p.

all i can ask for, :).

in the news thread, i think. this theme's challenge [which you won't participate in as the deadline is midnight today] is *Team Logos*.

do you have a GitHub acc an' if not, is it possible for you to make one? our chat thread is over there to prevent stalkin' an' it's an excellent tool for collabs.
? DATE: 1/30/2023, 8:46:46?AM
@Liftoff
85% complete. should be done by the end of tonight.


@ALL
new deadline is midnight tonight. less than 24 hours to put smth together, :).
? DATE: 1/30/2023, 6:43:29?AM
i don't want to put you in a situation you don't want to be in, :). the comp usually requires each participant to work for 3 to 5 hours a week.

there are themes, but they aren't strict so you don't have to follow 'em.
? DATE: 1/30/2023, 5:38:38?AM
try now. i was importin' a script that existed when i created this example but no longer does. [faulty `src` attribute]
? DATE: 1/30/2023, 5:27:08?AM
hi, :D!
yup. Bluebird's script has never truly worked an' the API was taken away so Liftoff's method doesn't work either.

so, yes an' no.
yes, there is a way, but it's certainly not easy by any means.
normally, you could just set the `src` of an image to the base64 data an' call it quits, but you're on KA an' that's a CSP violation.
to get 'round that, you'd have to draw the image off-KA on a canvas, get the `ImageData` that results, compress the image data, so it isn't a monster to save, then decompress the image data here an' draw it on the canvas with thumbnail.js. the compression part is not smth i'm familiar, but i'd be willin' to give it a go. if i could figure out how to do that, it'd pretty much be the equivalent of an Imagenator but not just for a singular data type (i.e. PNG or JPG). the compression would be hosted off-KA on GitHub.

optionally, you could just upload your image to wikimedia an' then display it with thumbnail.js. your screenshot is now on the internet for anyone else to use, but that's already the case with your webpage since it's under the MIT license.

you haven't seen it in its full glory yet. once you see it tuesday, you'll see that the only similarities between valor an' brave [my entry] are the dev [me] an' the genre [fps].

Levi's could certainly rival brave, but i'd say they're 'bout equal.

? DATE: 1/27/2023, 2:57:21?PM
in ski.js? i just added a function `loadFont` where you just enter the font name.

elsewhere? `_*https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/5442003232145408*_`
? DATE: 1/27/2023, 1:16:10?PM
yw, :D!

yup. what goes on behind the scenes to display KA graphix.

i have a demo here. literally the same as PJS.
`_*https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/5099165982179328*_`

nope. ES6 looks like this. there's more to learn, but it's not much for graphix devs.
```
function function_name (params) {
    //KA allows these
}
//an' this
const function_name = (params) => {
    //pretty much the same thin'
}
//what you might be used to
var function_name = function(params) {
    //good ol' KA nonsense
};
```

SMV's program was goin' to be converted after she released it, but given her current schedule she said she couldn't. to be clear, i could copy an' paste the exact same code into ski.js an' it would run fine. the only major difference that i encourage for graphix devs is function definitions [what i discussed 'bove]. i think i phrased it wrong 'fore. i strongly encourage the use of ES6+ syntax an' ski.js, but if you can't do it due to a busy schedule, i'm obviously not gon' be unreasonable. it shouldn't be too hard as you just declare functions differently. i can't rlly think of anythin' else you do differently.

oh an' you can import Google Fonts if you care to.
? DATE: 1/27/2023, 11:47:00?AM
sure thing, ;p.
? DATE: 1/27/2023, 11:05:44?AM
nope, you get to choose if we can see your email. i think you have to fill out a field intentionally for your email to appear publicly, ;p.

sounds good to me, :D!
idrc if you decide to use the canvas API instead, but my library is more user-friendly.
three main reasons as to why.
1.) bigger projex can be created with ski.js' efficiency. PJS severely limits the creativity you can express with its terrible inefficient functionz.
2.) it's a learnin' experience. everyone can now use ES6+ syntax an' featurez which makes codin' easier, not harder or more complex. ski.js also has additional functionality [mostly filters an' the new `curve` function] that can open up new opportunities.
3.) last an' i think least, entries score higher if only by a slim margin. it just looks more impressive to some of the less experienced judges [every judge looks at every program].

sounds good to me, ;p.
? DATE: 1/27/2023, 10:33:43?AM
to your question, only if you want to. the other two members are still technically on the team an' i can get 'em to submit a small smth if need be, but if you feel up to the challenge [deadline is monday] i can replace 'em now as the progress on the first round project would be the same.
? DATE: 1/27/2023, 10:30:26?AM
worse, laziness. they report to the chat thread but show no progress on their projex despite my urges to get movin'. i kicked 'em out lol an' went lookin' for peepz who ik would put in an effort.

so the site itself is a dauntin' prospect that's meant for professional developers an' i don't even know 1% of the website other than the rlly simple stuff. however, we use the easy part of the site. you create an account an' give us your username. we invite you to a repo [short for repository. it stores a bunch of code]. you accept the invite [there's a notification bell that automatically updates] an' go to the repo. click on the "Discussions" tab an' you'll find our chat thread there.

oh, smth that you might want to know is that you have to use the web environment/ski.js on my team [for reasons i can provide if you care to know 'em], *but* you pretty much code graphix as you would in PJS (i'm not even sure there would be any difference for you). your first challenge doesn't start 'till monday, so ask any questions you have 'till then, :D.

somewhat off of what Henry said, i'm afraid that my code might not be understood well not 'cuz it's overly complex [it could be done more inefficiently with simpler methods] but that the level of complexity needed might be beyond what most judges will know. for example, there will be a RegEx parser for level creation. i'll do my best to explain, but the judgez need to understand RegEx to understand my code without just takin' my code for what the comments say.

did i ever claim that anyone did anythin' wrong [even KA]? i don't think so. all i agreed with is that KA's activity levels are at an all-time low. 

KA can handle the situation as they like; it's their site an' we live with their decisions. Emma can create whatever projex she wants to; that's her choice. can i still find it slightly curious that voterz shot this project to the top of the HL [which is no fault of Emma's]? i hope so.

hypothetically, let's say that i have a library. i add to this library for my entry to fit my needz, but the library as a whole wasn't created for the comp. is the addition still judged or no?

at what point can we not reuse code? i remember last year it was when the homepage was released, but wanted to see if there were any adjustments to that policy.

can we kick peepz off the team for not performin' even tho they're technically "active"? not just for a day or two, but for nearly a week where they have not touched their entry whatsoever despite constant proddin' from their captain to just start. i think a warnin' first would be prudent, but i wanted to see if i have that capability 'cuz i didn't sign up for a third of my team to vanish into thin air.

the best way is to release a new version of the script an' set the version `@[version]` to the version you just created.

create a new release titled `0.0.1` with tag `v0.0.1` so GitHub will chill.
once you've published the new release, just change the version (which is currently set to `latest`) to `0.0.1`, ;p.

same as i told Levi. i'd rather my team learn more than any other team than score higher than any other team. everyone has to be ready to learn an' get out of their comfort zone on my team.

imho, you can't make a decent library in two weeks [from experience =/]. two hardest parts will be `text` an' vertices without needin' the user to use a `start` command.

you can't get `imageData` from a WebGL canvas, =/.

? DATE: 1/15/2023, 6:31:23?PM
you can't grab two different contexts from the same canvas an' since i grab the first canvas element in the body with ski.js [reason why thumbnail.js works the way it does], the contexts clash. if i had to guess, you import ski.js first, then use WebGL.

i figured out how to do it, but it's not entirely straightforward, if you care for me to show you how, :).

a few tips.

1. i would suggest a more complex background, perhaps even animated [perhaps a `canvas` tag?]
2. obviously members an' score page would be necessary for a finished product.

`noise` is not fast which is the biggest issue. i'll release it in a separate repo an' give you the link to import as it's p5.js' `noise` stripped down for efficiency [you can already see what i'll use in my projex].

welcome Liftoff, :D! glad to have you with us, ;p. if you could read the advisory 'bove if you haven't already, it would be greatly appreciated, :).

@ALL
welcome to team ninjaz, :D! glad to have every one of you on the team, :).
a few notes 'fore we begin the first round.
while i cannot mandate anythin' for this team, i _strongly encourage_ that we all follow the standards below.
```
1. every project must be in the web environment. [if you are used to PJS, you will use ski.js, the canvas API, or whatever canvas library you wish to use as long as you can satisfy the requirement below]
2. every project must utilize ES6+ syntax if JS is used. [ES6+ might sound dauntin', but it doesn't make codin' more complex, only easier]
3. all code will be run through a beautifier 'fore it is submitted. super simple, super easy an' saves pointz.
```
i would be more than happy to help those who might need help with this transition, :D.

lmk if you have any questions or concerns, :).

@TML & Samwise

i just ran a test an' looks to be a problem in your code. not sure where or what you think the problem is, but it seems to work as intended on my end.

it needs to be `args[1]`. basically it checks for the 3 rgb values from the string an' adds the last value `args[1]` as the alpha value. would run if called like this:
`fill(color(10, 20, 30), 40)`

i understand how a draft works an' the costs an' benefits of pickin' certain peepz.

riggin' a character allows me to move its limbs. i would need the full body of the ninja.

shoot, i forgot he had WCC as well. i'll switch Samwise with Ace for a safer bet. Samwise had been pretty solid last CoC. i don't expect to get snaked for any of my pix in the first two rounds, but we'll see. i think if anyone decides to snake you or DR, that would be a huge surprise an' loss for them. i need another [or backup] graphix dev, but i'm also tempted to take Chase earlier.

FF isn't on my list since ik that Henry already has him on his.

Liftoff won't be higher as web devs won't help unless the whole team is for web devs which won't happen due to the limited talent. TDJ an' Lemon could rlly switch places, but i think TDJ might be more prized by other captains, so Lemon would be second.

those users have nowhere to go. there's no site with KA's content. Python 3.0 was slower on the backend not frontend so we'll never truly see the impact but KA will. if KA improves or learners on every other section of KA except the KACP are able to excel better than they could 'fore (or even just one section), then it's worth it. the issue is that KA has just gone downhill. very few badges [hundreds less iirc]. no more backgrounds. crazy buggy discussion platform. all of these *hurt* learners. KA wants to die. that's their mission.

it's gotten worse, but it's out of our hands unless we hire a private investigator or report Y to the authorities in some other fashion but i don't think we'll ever get enough to dox Y on our own.

the situation hasn't entirely resolved itself, but we're currently stuck between a rock an' a hard place with no progress over the past few days. at this point, i can't do much else other than sit an' watch.

i won't mention names for reasons i'm sure you will understand, :).

i was approached by a user, i'll call him X, a lil' bit ago that there was an urgent situation regardin' bots. a user who you know, i'll call him Y, had been generatin' bots over a prolonged period of time. 1 million bots. X had created his own bots, but not for the malicious purposes that Y had an' shared his bot gen script with me. they were quite similar to that of Y, if not better. sent most of what we knew to KA (what i've said here. there's more but i can't discuss that here.) as well as the developments that have occurred over the past week or so to get 'em to stop the creation of bots entirely. KA did what KA does best. i'm sure you have an idea what that would be.

i've resumed development on all collabs (an' added another one to the list, smh), so there should be progress soon, :D.

i'll sum it up for you.

WKoA has refused to comply with the ToS that he agreed to. this caused quite a conflict with the Guardians an' still does.

a lil' over a week ago, i was quite unhappy with CL (i think you saw) for the poor effort that he continually puts into his projects. the thread got out of hand an' i deleted it. in that thread, WKoA popped up an' i left a rather snarky comment for him. i had originally left a much harsher comment in the Khancorrenza "trash" thread, but it was hidden for whatever reason an' consequently deleted.

it ought to be noted that he took rather drastic measures when he wasn't banned by postin' a highly controversial flag an' intentionally targetin' the "liberal" population of this site. he has noted that his sole goal is to eradicate the site of LGBTQIA+ programs.

in the Khantober thread which has been deleted due to spam, i had attempted to post another snarky comment to a user who had been banned comparin' him to WKoA. the attempt never followed through, but a project with my post in the comments remained. WKoA found the post an' decided to leave a comment of his own. he alerted the Guardians of my "rude" behavior (who acknowledged his alert), but over the past 3 days no action has been taken. i've been harassed since.

let me know when you see this an' respond as you see fit. this project may be deleted at any time in the near future as you are aware of the situation which should be sufficient. i would prefer to leave WKoA banned if possible.

KA already stores the project data on their end without the need of your replit. i deleted it so you'd stop poppin' up.

you're startin' to sound more an' more like Drained.

dude, lay off.

it's an online _learnin'_ platform, but your sole goal is to discriminate against another group. LGBTQIA+ are still people. they're just like you an' me. just 'cuz you don't agree with 'em doesn't mean you get to wage war.

you're stubborn an' insensible simply due to your ignorance of others an' the rules set in place by the Guardians. go make your own learnin' platform if you don't like KA.

i appreciate your response. i have decided to neglect to respond in kind as everythin' that should be said has been said (at least to you).

i have the right to freedom of speech. if you don't like what i have to say, ignore it.

the reason why i don't capitalize "i" is due to the stress it puts upon oneself. i see it as selfish. in addition, it makes the glorious Name of our Heavenly Father stick out a bit more, no?

the choice of apostrophes is dialect.

@YIVauEivoj YIVauEivoj
the Guardians are rather indiscriminate of what they hide based on _users_. now, discrimination against the content of the program rather than the Guidelines is quite arguable, but that's for another day somewhere else.

they have hidden `externals` every single time it pops up on the HL up until, well, now. they might have the weekend off, or maybe they've decided it isn't worth their time. perhaps Guardians are leavin' due to KA's executives (see KA's Glassdoor reviews) an' now they're understaffed. whatever the reason is, the outcome is the same. these projects have yet to be hidden.

@HSstudent16
i wonder if they would let wikimedia images fly...
on another thought, i wonder what their restrictions against API calls from PJS will be.

i've been told by Evan that *any* use of `externals` will be hidden from the HL, regardless of its actual use. perhaps the policy changed without notice.

there actually isn't a "canvas" method.

there are two methods. Polar's stubborn method (which Henry originally used) an' the stylesheet method.

Polar's method calls the font in a script, but you have to have the link to the font's file in Google's server in order to use it rather than just the name.

i prefer usin' the `link` method which you normally use. 
`<link href = 'font link here' rel = 'stylesheet'>`
then call `textFont(fontNameInStringForm, fontSize)`
you don't need to wrap the font name with `createFont`.

you may ask, why not add a `loadFont` function? the reason is that the page doesn't load twice, so if the `draw` function isn't used an' the `text` function not made `asynchronous` (which would screw so many more things up) your font would never load an' the text would be set to the default `sans-serif`.

? DATE: 8/5/2022, 2:55:38?PM
heyo, :D!

i think either Liftoff or Leviathan invented the method. i've used it for the mountaintop homepage an' trava, an' i must tell you that it's a pain to deal with, hence thumbnail.js.

anyways, here's how it works. 
```
1.) grab your base 64 image data. 
2.) open the *Network* tab in your browser's console
3.) you should see a request sent that begins with your project ID. *right-click* on it.
4.) under the *Copy* menu, select *Copy as fetch*
5.) go to the *Console* tab. 
6.) *paste* the data
7.) there should be a long string containin' the base 64 image data (under the "image_url" key tho don't look for "image_url" as the JSON object isn't well formatted). *replace* the base 64 image data with yours (note that it only works with PNGs an' GIFs).
8.) *press enter* to send the request
9.) *enjoy* you hard earned thumbnail! 
```
once you've done it, it's pretty straightforward. just make sure that you have saved a copy of the base 64 image data in case you need to make changes to the webpage after release, :).
? DATE: 8/4/2022, 10:59:34?AM
the most important part is that you can use `import` in the `module`, but not with Some Name's method (no offense meant to Some Name).
? DATE: 8/4/2022, 10:21:51?AM
we were talkin' bout portin' scripts from GitHub to KA. if you wish to use ES6+ classes in the KA HTML environment, you can simply assign the `type` attribute to `module` an' not use the brackets, :).

i went through some of your code an' will continue to further make it efficient in the future. you can easily manipulate arrays like so (tho in the web environment, it's much easier).
```
//copy arrays
Array.prototype.copy = function(){
    return this.concat();
};
var a = [1, 2, 3];
var b = a;
b.push(4);
println(a);
println(b);

//check if two arrays are equal to each other
Array.prototype.equals = function(arr){
    if(this.length === arr.length){return this.every(function(item, index){return item === arr[index];});}
};
var a = [1, 2, 3], b = [2, 2, 3], c = [2, 2, 3];
println(a.equals(b));
```
? DATE: 7/13/2022, 10:50:02?AM

? DATE: 4/7/2022, 1:16:18?PM
so, i ran the project at the maximum possible speed that `setInterval` would go, an' i got this.
`_*https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/themischeviouspachyderm/projects*_`

lucky for me, i had the ingenious idea of lookin' at the network tab in my browser's console. here's the good news an' the bad news.
good news: so, it is doin' as i said above where it's sendin' multiple requests to KA, but not for the reason i thought. whenever KA tries to create a new webpage, it errors out as the script runs over it to an extent. the only issue is that the webpage is still saved. so, KA tries to continuously create new webpages until smth clicks on their end.
bad news: 
a.) i now have an alt filled with 20+ programs of a singular project.
b.) i only saw 4 projects error out, but as you can see, there are way, way, way more. took a good 20 seconds to save the project.
c.) someone could use it to boost their project on the HL by simply creatin' a ridiculous amount of spin-offs.

edit: nevermind, i just tried with an alt an' 120 spin-offs didn't move it on the HL at all.
? DATE: 4/7/2022, 10:06:08?AM
yup!

a few ways to do it.
a.) go online an' find a PNG to base 64 converter (there are tons out there). i even know one on KA if you want the link.
b.) if you want to copy a KA project to base 64 data, you'll need to use some `canvas` element methods. here's an idea of how one would do it in PJS.
```
//top of code.
var externals, canvas = externals.canvas;
//end of code.
//you'll need the browser's console as println is a lot more resource intensive an' will crash your browser.
debug(canvas.toDataURL());
```

just remember that your file shouldn't exceed 750kb. otherwise, KA won't take it.
? DATE: 4/6/2022, 3:07:45?PM
i believe you once said that you're a master of overengineerin' or smth of the sort. i must be your apprentice.

'cuz accessin' `canvas` is much more fun. who doesn't want to create an HTML image element in PJS without HTML? found a hybrid. the legitimate reason as to why is that i can use the same method for wikimedia images, so that means i could create a function for both.

edit: on second thought, yours is much easier to incorporate elsewhere.

edit (2x): works wonderfully. thanks!

hmm, i have a WIP at the moment that will be released for CoC round 1 called valor that is an FPS. i had to rush it in 4 days, so we might do another FPS based on valor (titled honor?) that would be much better. i've also had a knack for battle simulations, so we could do an FPS where you're in the middle of a battle?

we pretty much only align from 1-3 A.M., but that should work, :D!

edit: if you're up for a big project, we could try an RPG. that would be interestin', and i have an idea on how the general functionality would work.

i knew you had worked with Unity before, and WebGL is made by Unity so you might have a some idea as to the answers.
a.) in the program linked, i'm drawin' all of the coordinates on lines 62 to 98. they _should_ draw an octahedron, but they don't. i know that an octahedron has 12 vertices, but i have no clue what those other 4 vertices would be.

lol, yes and no. yes, we have a basic premise. no, we have no real characters. my best shot is below, but i'm not the greatest in the creativity department, :p.

your name is ____ (jake? or something gender-neutral like charlie?). you wake up one morning in your small quaint town of Tutol. (note all proper nouns that are not names were generated by my random word generator. `_*https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/-/5123081716596736*_`) as you walk outside a neighbor stops and tells you about the horrifying news. the precious cottonball (something silly, it was the first thing it thought up of) that your great-great-grandfather had prized had been stolen from the local museum. (perhaps this is all a cutscene and the cutscene ends here?) you have to go talk to Bob (he'll look like a character graphic one of my friend's made.) to learn that he lost his lucky coin (penny?) in the garden nearby. you go into the garden and find the lucky coin which you give to Bob. Bob then gives you a book to give to the librarian in the library (most likely in a separate world map). the librarian gives you a coin that you spend at a local breakfast stop for a donut. you give the donut to Winston who gives you a taco. the taco is given to the mayor who is starving after his house flooded due to some squirrels triggering his fire alarm. the mayor gives you a key to an old room in the library that you open to find a pair of glasses on the floor. you bring the pair of glasses to an old man (not too far from Bob) who gives you a key to go to the upper floor in the breakfast shop. you go up to find the prized cottonball waiting in the middle of the hallway. the game ends when you take the cottonball back to its rightful place in the museum. that transitions to the end scene which says "you may have found the cottonball. but who stole it?" i was thinking that it could be the squirrels, Bob, or the mayor. i would need to write all of this dialogue out, but i think this is a good start.

The game is more about how many times you play as you find the tricks behind each level. The best tip is to constantly run in circles.

Decreased Level 9's time. I've added Level 7 and  level 8 (meant for health regen).
? DATE: 11/3/2021, 7:15:17?AM
I've tried for about an hour, but I'm not sure how to make a transition between levels. It seems like it will have to be a separate function that is called on line 402 or so rather than in the draw function. If you have any questions on my messy code, feel free to ask.

As for the defender, he seems to lack some basic knowledge and creates rather poor quality programs. His game reiterates different functions for collisions instead of directly checking collisions for each object.

? DATE: 10/20/2020, 9:25:52?AM
Alright, I do have a couple of suggestions.

1.) Trees need to have a spawn variable, so we can add levels with more difficulty as the plot progresses.

2.) I would suggest making the bullets the same color, so they might be distinguishable.

3.) They should have spurts (every 250 frames or so) in which they spray a certain amount of seeds and bullets per say 1 seed and 3 to 5 bullets based on difficulty. Seeds should have a chance of dying as well.
? DATE: 10/19/2020, 11:07:44?AM
Spawning is automatic, so there is a timer that goes off. Summoning is the ability to create an enemy while the timer has not gone off for that enemy.

that's how posterize should look. you're usin' posterize only on the gradient itself not anythin' the gradient is applied to/on. in order to do the latter, you'd need to crash performance by at least 3x an' run the filter every frame.

i lost half my team at the start of a competition an' then found replacements. well, some of the original team an' the replacements dropped out, so i'm back to half a team. lookin' for any an' all replacements rn.

to be very clear, i'm not askin' for a time commitment. i'm not askin' for a full-time member who grinds day in an' day out without sleep to crank out what they can. two to three hours a week would be appreciated, or not even that, any an' all help, no matter the perceived insignificance, is greatly appreciated. an example would be just the buttons for a menu, not the menu itself.

"Dark.js hopes to fix a few technicaly issues with ski.js, be much faster than ProcessingJS, but also add new features that make using Dark.js worth it"

love to see the grind, man. openin' an issue on ski.js would be too easy, a PR that just fixed the issue would've been laziness, you had to recreate the library from scratch.

saw this on GitHub 'fore i saw it here believe it or not.

i've spent over a year on ski.js an' it's not just my knowledge that went into that project but the enormous wealth of knowledge the greatest programmers on KA possess. PT, HS, Polar, bravo bravo, the names go on an' on. VEXCESS an' Polar miserably failed at their own creation; i'd love to see what you come up with, but i will warn you that it's next to impossible to beat 10+ programmers over a year as one person in a month or so. 

at the very least this project is a worthy endeavor, :). it's noteworthy for one to want to create their own canvas library. it's another to claim you'll beat ski.js.

probs belongs in questions but whatevs.

so 21262 has asked to join my team, but there's currently some debate over the matter. if you could tell him, that i [more like we] am considerin' his proposition but have not come to a definitive conclusion yet. i'm currently not a fan of the idea that participants get to choose their teams as you've taken a hard stance on the matter with Phantom Falcon last year an' your note to SMV this year. cap'ns should have the say imho, but that's just my two cents an' this isn't my comp, ;p.

how do you level the playin' field out if not all teams can have 7 members an' all members of team Henry want to still participate? i don't think it'd be fair to tell any member of team Henry that they can't participate anymore, but if they do, do the teams who have 6 rather than 7 members get to recruit more? that sounds like a decent idea since all teams are somewhat back to where they started but also are somewhat in a better position. just tryin' to figure out how it all works out, :).

how would you have improved the enemy algorithm? the movin' aspect would've required a freeform pathfindin' algorithm of which there is no documentation anywhere on the web. the attack an' movement could be triggered by when the player is close enough to the enemy, but i don't think that is what you had in mind as that's literally one line.

first, i don't fully understand the Web Audio API so if you could explain what `AudioContext`, `AudioBuffer`, `AudioBufferSourceNode`, an' `GainNode` are, it would be much appreciated, :D!

second, i'm not sure what you did, but what text does the audio need? it doesn't look like it's base64 encoded. i think i could figure out the rest from there, but i'm stuck as to how i would recreate this in a faster environment [the web environment with imported scripts]. i can have the string size be as long as necessary, but i can't run your C++ code as i'm stuck on a chromebook atm.

nav link hover script with a tad bit more efficient script, ;p.
```
let links = document.getElementsByClassName("navlink");
    for(const link of links){
        link.onmouseover = () => {
            for(const l of [...links].filter(el => el !== link)) l.style.opacity = 0.3
        };
        
        link.onmouseout = () => {
            for(const l of links) l.style.opacity = 1
        }
    }
```
i'd add a blur filter to the nav background. 

i feel like the hero is the only thin' that doesn't fit. the color scheme doesn't mesh well. maybe more blue an' green?

you shouldn't be able to scroll while the nav is open.

lovin' the simple homepages just like last year, :D.

good luck to you an' your team, :).

a few notes on the code.
1. do you not indent the tags inside of the `head` or `body` tag?
2. it's terribly inefficient to use `querySelector`, so here's a quick fix for lines 205 to 206 in case you care to. [line 211 will need to be `for(const el of links)`]
```
const cursor = document.getElementsByClassName('cursor')[0]
const links = document.getElementsByTagName('a')
```
3. curious to know why you wrap the `event` parameter `e` in parentheses when it isn't necessary. is it better codin' practice?
4. any particular reason why you wrapped your `link` tags with a `div`?

? DATE: 12/9/2022, 5:49:08?PM
to answer your first question, it simply isn't efficient to do so. i would need to record every random value possible an' assign those values accordin' to when the function was called which is not safe as the number of times the random numbers were called varies. the only other way would be to inefficiently employ the same method as PJS. i don't think it will matter too much, but i can manually adjust the random values for each tree if you feel like we need `randomSeed` i could try to import PJS, but that's too much of a headache.

as to your second point, you have two conditionals at once for `i` in your `for` loop. you need two different `for` loops as the first conditional for TRAVA ends first, so the same number of characters (5) is what is displayed of TELENOVA. all strings come with a built-in property `length` so there's no reason to `.split('')`, :).

? DATE: 9/17/2022, 2:40:34?PM
i'm sorry Jake. i just had to tear this to pieces once i saw the code.

first, the compliments.

absolutely beautiful transitions, :D! wonderfully unique, distinct an' most certainly eye catchin'.

that Lorenz attractor is quite nice, ;p.

an' then, we all saw it comin'.

this is actually one of the only programs of yours where i feel that there was a lack of effort, or perhaps you were rushed. either way there is _a lot_ to be improved upon an' i've only listed the few (okay, several) things that jumped out at me.

a.) the font choice might blind some users. with this color scheme, it just doesn't mesh. at all.

b.) black an' white do not work. don't do it. unless you're goin' all out with the design of the webpage you *cannot* sacrifice color.

c.) the cacteye avatar is in side of a neat little box that nearly blends with the background. make it pop out by borderin' it with white instead of puttin' black on black.

d.) the use of green on this webpage, particularly that shade of green, just does not mesh again. the colors should pop out without bein' an eyesore.

e.) you're in the web environment. _use it._ ES6+ syntax is available to you with extra benefits, but instead you settled for good ol' painful ES5.

f.) while i complimented your transitions, you also did it in the most painfully complicated manner. simply chainin' the animations an' displays with `onanimationend` would've worked beautifully without causin' the code to look like Greek.

g.) your backgrounds are plainly just pasted into the webpage as if you just picked the first search result. a webpage should be a harmonious symphony of color not chaos.

h.) there should only be two animations, at the very most 4. once the user hovers over the element, once the user moves out of the element, an' optionally, once the user clicks on the element. perhaps there could be an intro or `onscroll` animation as well, if deemed necessary. on the news page, you change from the terrible black an' white to an even harsher blue an' white to a blindin' green an' white that bobs up an' down an' screams "look at me steal your vision from years to come!".

i.) JSONP an' callback functions are much easier to use than _jQuery_. the KA devs can't get their implementations straight. the creator of _jQuery _leads the KA devs. what does that say 'bout _jQuery_? additionally, it's more of an easy way out, so to speak.

j.) space out operations. instead of `1+1` write `1 + 1`.

small critique:
the hands should go on the keyboard instead of the arms reachin' 'round the laptop.

? DATE: 7/20/2022, 6:28:50?AM
i would think that this would be a slightly more efficient implementation on lines 42 to 51:
```
const styles = document.getElementsByTagName('style-sass')
for(const style of styles){
    Sass.compile(style.textContent, result => {
        const style = document.createElement('style')
        style.innerHTML = result.text
        document.head.appendChild(style)
    })
    style.remove()
}
document.body.style.display = 'block'
```

somebody already voted this who wasn't me, o.o.

just a couple things i learned from _tutol_.
a.) i'd probs make the enemy & npc objects separate.
b.) i have a typin' function we could use to make it look nice. this also means that the dialogue logic is nuts. here's how i set it up previously, tho we should probs make it more efficient. all of the npc data was stored in an array title, well, _npc_data_.
```
/**
 * list of variables and what they do for NPC dialogue:
 * in @Player:
     * this.listen checks to see if the player is listening.
 * in @NPC:
     * this.dialogue is the array of dialogue for the NPC.
     * this.talking is the boolean to determine whether or not
       the NPC should update the typing/talking.
     * this.done is the boolean for whether the talking is done
       for the NPC.
     * this.phew is the boolean for whether the talking is done
       for the player.
     * this.check is the boolean "loading" the dialogue before
       talking.
     * this.given controls whether or not the player has been
       given the object needed.
     * this.have is the boolean for whether or not the player
       has the item the NPC wants.
     * this.checkered is a boolean made to make sure that the
       second dialogue is typed and that it isn't repeated.
     * this.type is the constructor for type.
 * in @type:
     * this.t is the wanted text.
     * this.txt is the returned text.
     * this.char is the character that this.txt is on of this.t
     * this.del is whether or not text is being deleted.
     * this.speed is how fast the text is written.
     * this.done is whether or not the text is done being typed.

wow, this looks like a kacp need of revival, smh.

edit: ia, levi f., _and_ CowboyFan_ on your tail. i'll link a post of mine below. this message was not directed at you when posted. doubt you'll read it or respond, but worth a shot.

"The hardest problem about Khan Academy is its breeding ground for sociology. What I mean by that is, you put thousands and thousands of users onto a single platform over ~ten years, and as that platform ages, you see a growth, climax, and the eventual decline. Now, the KACP (as defined by Willard [the creator of MineKhan] who I had a similar discussion with) is most like a representative democracy, not necessarily a republic by technical definition. This means that all of the voters (below 13 or "childed" and above 13) select which programs will receive their vote. Now, the government urges voters to stay informed, so that come election time, you know what you're voting on.(I believe it is reasonable safe to believe that you live in the United States of America.) More accurately, voters choose which creators will receive their votes. Now by the connotation most often used, "voter fraud" is not plentiful on KA and is nearly non-existent as no specific instance (that follows the connotation) has been recorded. A separate wholly unique and unprecedented issue plagues KA, quality. Effort and time are thrown aside when choosing which programs are selected as "hot". Voters choose whichever program pleases, entertains, or brings the most enjoyment to them, so the best solution for this aspect is to keep the voter informed as to the need for supporting programs that require an intense effort as opposed to those that do not but bring the same entertainment value if you will. This task will be incredibly difficult to accomplish due to the natural desires of the users based on previous voting history, and the fact that no one has decided to address this issue which I find beyond appalling. In conclusion, I will probably inform the viewer of the necessity of supporting the programs that required an "intense effort".

Now the other issue that is much more plausible to fix is that there are low-quality projects in the first place. There are two causes to this issue, and I will address both. The first is that new programmers feel left out and wish to be known like all of these other programmers. It can be pretty intimidating when someone realizes just how difficult it is to garner votes and attention. As Lin Gh. put it (I assume you know who she is.), (note that this is a paraphrase) "It isn't a bad thing to want votes." There are much, much worse ways to get votes, and a platformer template or two or a meme here and there won't bring Armageddon, but it is most certainly a cause of alarm. Either the programmer feels this desire to be popular without effort (unsolvable from our position), or the desire to be popular with effort but no one willing to pay attention. Hence, the best way to solve this issue is to constantly monitor the "Recent" list and vote on projects vote-worthy, regardless on whether or not they are noticed.

The last cause is that these programmers may have the capacity to become stellar programmers, but are lacking the assistance needed to create such projects. These would be projects that may not seem quality at the surface, but to the user seem to the utmost standard. The best way to solve this issue is to help as many users as possible which KA has conveniently built a system in just for that. Help requests and discussion questions are being answered frequently, and help is in abundance, so what is the problem? We are neglecting to help those who don't feel comfortable to post help requests, perhaps out of fear of being insulted for being "so dumb" (which I have found a user who did as said recently) or of "not being good enough". I might seem to be taking this to an extreme, but you cannot deny the reality that the KACP is facing. (If you would like me to hunt down the post, I would be glad to.) How do you help someone who doesn't ask for it? How do you meet a need that you don't even know exists? By providing constructive, positive feedback that nurtures those programmers to their fullest potential regardless if they ask. Now, you shouldn't tell them that what they are doing is wrong, but rather suggest that there is a better way. If someone seems to have a hit a roadblock, go the extra mile and fix it for them regardless if they ask. If a user sees this as intrusive, then we will respect their wishes, but unless otherwise noted helping, supporting, and caring are the best options."

edit: it is more frustrating then anything for me, but consider the other novice programmers that could have made it on the HL if your program hadn't taken up a spot. what if the next GG is just waiting to be found but can't find the motivation without being noticed? please be considerate of others.

This looks amazing. I'll have to wait to see how it turns out. Also, you should probably color the tree trunks a little darker if you care to, :).

If you don't mind me asking (you don't have to answer), but what happened with 'OsuKi-ai!'? Has he just become less active?

I'd play it if you _gave_ me money, >:). It really depends on complexity and user experience, so without knowing what others think of it I can't really say anything.

Hmm...interesting. The purple text doesn't really fit Oh Noes and the dark background. Despite being a Thanos quote, `fill(150,200,150);` works better. It is practically the color of Oh Noes, so it looks like he is saying it. Besides, the color of the text (which is probably just me), the particles were done pretty well to reform Oh Noes.

glad you enjoy it, :D!

`window.open` is the key. relevant code is on lines 695 to 707.

1. open the window an' assign it to a variable. `const win 
= window.open()`
2. open the document for that window. `win.document.open()`
3. write the contents of the current webpage into the document. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is standard practice for all webpages which is followed by the `outerHTML` [includes the tag of the element] of the `html` tag. `win.document.write("<!DOCTYPE html>" + ${document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].outerHTML})`
4. close the document since we're done writin'. `win.document.close()`
5. this is a unique aspect of my fullscreen functionality. set the `fullscreen` attribute of the new `window` to true [`!0` is a shortcut of sorts]. `win.fullscreen = !0`.

based on whether the `fullscreen` attribute is true i display the fullscreen icon, therefore you can't open a new screen once you're already in fullscreen mode.
? DATE: 2/23/2023, 7:24:08?PM
yes, please. i have no clue why KA won't recognize the two functions `println` an' `clearLogs` as globals. it started at 1.8.6 an' kept goin' 'till 1.8.8, =/.
? DATE: 2/20/2023, 4:10:00?PM
based on PJS, it's for everythin' which is what i based mine off of.

it might make more sense to do everythin' but transformations for greater user control, but that's also reduced performance.

a better question would be if you want rage's collisions in particular or just circle-rect collisions. i've optimized the collisions further in the `collision.js` addon of ski.js, but here's the code from rage.

no promises, but i might give it a whirl.

actually `var` counts as a global variable as long as the script type is not set to `module`, ;p.
? DATE: 2/1/2023, 11:10:42?AM
not yet. it's missin' a bunch of featurez, so i'll add those in soon an' release then.

there's a major bug with enemy collisions that i haven't fixed [enemies glitch through wallz] an' there are s'pposed to be multiple maps in the town. i might update the couch graphic as well as the weapon GUI in the release as well.
? DATE: 2/1/2023, 10:25:51?AM
the first thin' to consider is that you're forced to work in a module which isn't attached to the global scope. line 2694 wouldn't work.

`fps` is a global variable that defines fps instead of `this.__frameRate`.

event listeners haven't always worked properly, so you'll need to add the `event` parameter. instead of `mousebutton`, `e.button`. instead of `key`, `e.key`. instead of `keyCode`, `e.keyCode`.

i don't see anythin' else right away.
ski.js doesn't differ from PJS that much. it only opens the door for more complex JS. i'll get back to you with Embers in ski.js when i get the chance.

nope. hasn't worked since the project API endpoints were deprecated a couple weeks ago, =/.

first an' foremost, it allows us to create bigger projex without bein' limited by PJS.

second, everyone will be able to employ more advanced programmin' concepts which opens a learnin' opportunity.

last but not least, it is bound to improve our score if even by a small margin due to code complexity.

create a new project. post your code. adjust the width an' height as necessary. done.
? DATE: 10/10/2022, 4:21:55?PM
i've never personally reached the character limit, but i've been told that the file size of any program cannot exceed 1MB. savin' will simply error out an' the "save" button will be stuck on "saving..."

the best way is to store all code on GitHub. there are issues with this such as the need to constantly test an' tweak code. i would work on chunks of the code at a time. due to the limitations an' restrictions of this environment (particularly the scope of exported variables), there are quite a few workarounds necessary for different situations.

if you want a surefire method that would only last for a few months (perhaps less), you could simply abuse (not literally) the API.

could i have a link?

three ideas that come to mind.

a.) blank nodes were needed for older browsers (specifically IE), but KA no longer supports IE so idk (they've also made some pretty darn silly dev mistakes, so i wouldn't put it past 'em havin' things that don't need to be there).

b.) blank nodes could just be empty `script` tags for imported scripts or `link` tags for stylesheets. it depends on which nodes these are.

c.) since you're in a sandboxed `iframe`, we don't have full access, so they could've restricted the capability of webpages to read the nodes.

unless smth changed, i think you should still be able to access what you need without encounterin' the blank nodes. i would at least be able to find a workaround for you, :).
? DATE: 8/20/2022, 6:59:38?PM
that's the issue. you'd have to know the previous endpoints to utilize 'em.

there's actually quite a lot on spin-offs currently in the API, _BUT_ it seems that KA goes off the data initially set, so it can't be changed (a.k.a. i've already tried). width an' height can be changed after the program is initially saved, as well as thumbnail, in normal conditions but the content type won't.
