When does joining start/close? If ski's captain, but b4nned until 10 Jan, who'll make the thread for people to sign up under him?
• DATE: 11/18/2022, 4:31:09 PM
Honestly quite flattered, mate, but why don't you make it a spinoff?

Just letting yk...

_ice to meet you #FirstKhantuber:_
Could we have an extra day to work on the project for this week? I did most of what I needed to do, but the person I'm working with hasn't had power and hasn't worked been able to work on our project for 4 days now.

_Me:_
I won't extend the formal deadline, but I'll accept your project late with no penalty :)

- What is `l` and why is it there lol
- `b.split("")` is entirely unnecessary
- `random` doesn't work outside of here which is why I used `Math.random()` :p
- And `let` > `var` B)

And that is why mine (https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/5672689696292864, for the random future stalkers) is better =P

mr grammer, how on Earth did you manage to misspell "shield" as "sheild" _This. Many. Times?!_

I think that comment, "It is entertaining to call out the grammar of those who call out others," was your most teasable comment xD
• DATE: 3/3/2023, 9:41:27 PM
I know I'm late, but you literally copied someone else's code, changed a few colours, and then added ellipses onto the right eye. I do not at _all_ believe this deserves 27 votes (1/3rd of the original), but I am not going to flag it. However, the next time you _conveniently_ forget to make a spinoff, you'll most certainly get flagged, so _please_ give due credit; putting a link at the top _does not count_ as such. If you can find the time to copy and paste into a new program, surely you're capable of finding the juicy blue button at the bottom-right of the program titled "Spin-off"? 

Remember: don't code for votes. Code for yourself. Code to improve. Oki? Good luck :)

Biscuits aren't pastries, tho, they're literally American cookies (which aren't pastries) 'cept with a different [_ahem_ the _-correct-_ name] :P

(Other than that, totally accurate; I definitely walk around wearing a monocle xD

That pixel art is pretty freakin' sweet :o
So's the rigging :D
It could use a 'lil colour tho, the background's an easy fix for that, maybe make it blue instead of grey?
It'd be better with a 'lil more juicing, as Longtreader said. Also a menu page and the like would help :p

Noice job, mr bread × mr maple syrup × NIKO × Akbaba :D

Idk why I'm here, but I'm too lazy to actually work on smthn for my team for CoC, so yeah ig this is what I do now... =p

This is an awesome graphic :D
Although, you drew out _every, single_ vertex? I could never have enough patience to do that... That's why I use loops _inside_ of `beginShape`/`endShape` =D

Oh, if you're using the bricks like this, on line 771, change the `let rndm = 80 + random (80)` to `let rndm = 70 + random (45)` because it looks _awful_ atm. I'm not gonna say anything else rn b'cuz you're clearly not done :)

Yeah, life sucks sometimes
Like lollipops
Both sweet and sucky at the same time

(...If it's currently sucky, it'll _have_ to stop sucking b'cuz you'll eventually be left with the weird stick thingy that you _can't_ suck so you'll have to get another lolly to suck but then things are sweet again :p)

So moral: life sucks like a lollipop but it'll get better and sweeter again :)

You must be tired of all that fantastic ski-coding goin'  on so I'll just be here to give you company (...and possibly end up distracting you in which case just don't answer my annoying butt :P)

To make you feel a 'lil better, some good news, you've regained your nickname, mr-savage-ninja-legendary-pro-gong-player-elsa! 
(...Oki, whilst that would have absolutely not made you feel better, comedic relief, at least, _amirite?_ Ig you'd have been coding for like an hour and a half, so have some hot cocoa or smthn and don't overload yourself, mate >;P)

Ah, interesting.
May I ask why we _want_ a beginner?
"2 graphic dev, 3 game devs, 1 beginner"

And why no other web devs? 
You'd said everybody might be going out of their comfort zone (or something along those lines) earlier on GH, so if there were more webpages to be made, perhaps another person decent at that instead of a beginner?

Sorry, I must be very annoying right now (and honestly in general, eh, mr savage ninja) to be questioning your decisions. Trust ya enough to at least _hope_ you know what you're doing, just curious as to the reasoning behind it =P

_ski:_
"my description:
ski is the only returnin' CoC captain an' beat the rest of KA as the winner of CoC's first round last year. there's only one legend.

ski is lookin' for those who are willin' to grind day in an' day out an' possess great talent an' skill. those who aren't afraid to lose an' wish to learn more than win. ski believes cooperation an' unity are crucial to success.

my vote:
recreational recreations an' nightmares & dreams."

You replaced the trees! :D
Although, you should probably take off cool guy coding's name saying he made 'em, XD

Also, on line 138, could you replace it with `ellipse (random (100, 180) + random(25)*sin(frameCount*random(5)), random (200, 20), rndm, rndm);`?  Sorry XP
• DATE: 1/1/2023, 3:11:12 PM
**aggressively spam-clicks to watch sword go _boing**_
Lookin' good! 
The tree trunks are rather disproportionate, though. And inefficiently done.
=/

Here, replace the inside of the tree function with:
```
    pushMatrix();
    scale(s/80);
    translate(x, y);
    
    noStroke();
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 30; i+= 10) 
    {
        fill (0 + i*3, 0, 0);
        rect (100 + i, 140, i, 208);
    }
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) 
    {
        var rndm = random(20, 80);
        fill (0, 100 + i*0.8, 0);
        ellipse (random (100, 180)+random(5)*sin(frameCount*random(5)), random (200, 20), rndm, rndm);
    }
    
    popMatrix();
```
and then add `randomSeed(1);` to the draw function and tell me what ya think... =P

Is this the collab you and DR are doing? =P
Looks cool :D
(Random thought... Ya know how the dirt blocks' lines look like they say RM? What if you change the vertexes [lines 296-309] to smthn looking like your logo? Instead of RM, maybe DR x LG? Idk if that makes sense, but... :p)

(Ex: trees for internet, volcano for airplanes, snow for slinkies, beach for microwaves, another volcano for biscuits, grass for robots, and a galaxy for computers)
- On the nav-bar, the words only show up if you hover _directly_ over them. It's honestly very awkward and not very user-friendly.
- The fonts. 'Nuff said. They're... Not good, to say the least.
- On the learning page, whilst hovering over them, they become half transparent and that also looks very awkward. It's also a little confusing, as I expected to be taken to another page if I click it (which is what one would think with a hover animation. Or perhaps I'm just an idiot... v(0-0)v)

This looks really nice! My skin is a bit more tan, maybe `rgb(217, 140, 102);`, so the face's stroke would be `rgb(207, 130, 91);` perhaps =P
The [my? lol] hair looks amazing! Ya nailed the colour :D

Hi! 
Sorry, I'm a bit of a moron, lol.
You've won for Caela! Amazing job! And for Pruina!
But... As the colours don't contrast with the background, could you make the `background (0, 0);`? Don't worry, you don't need to change anything about the avatars... They're looking great! I'm going to change the background of the images whilst inserting them into the page so they contrast a bit, enough to see well. Idk if this makes any sense, and I'm really sorry for the confusion (wow, I'm a horrible host lol), but could you set the background as that for all the avatars? 
uwu

*New thread*

_Same rules apply as 1st thread._

...
Note: If you join this thread, be prepared for a _lot_ of notifications XP

...
*A quick disclaimer for fl@g-happy people*
_Technically, this is not violating any rules._

They are as follows:

"Fl@g as abuse
disrespectful or offensive, an advertisement

Fl@g as a question
Should be in “Questions”

Fl@g as not helpful
Low quality, not about the video topic, soliciting votes or seeking badges, a homework question, repeatedly making the same post

Fl@g as about the site
A question about Khan Academy (e.g. “What software does Sal use?”), a post about badges, a technical problem with the site, a request for videos or features"

_Although certain parts of this thread go off-topic, it clearly does not violate anything above._

Furthermore, in the guidelines it says:
"...Social groups or clubs, or projects that generate social chats, and other posts not related to coding, in the discussion thread..."

_This is regarding the project getting hidden on the HL. This is -not- on the HL. No problem there!
Neither the guidelines nor fl@gs explicitly state anything to do with off-topic discussion *threads* so it can all be left up to viewer interpretation, making it somewhat easy to argue oneself out of a possible mess..._ >;D

_NOTE: I may not be able to give you your first choice of teams. If you desperately want to be on one team and find yourself elsewhere, don't hesitate to make your case! :D_
• DATE: 11/25/2022, 11:11:54 PM
Okay. We need a 'teams' page. It was a little confusing to read this, and when I'm converting this to a webpage (adding the main content rn), I think it's pretty much necessary to have all the information complete XP

Just give me these and I'll fill in the rest. 
- How many teams are there? 
- What are their names? 
- Are we really doing this avatar contest? 
- What is our fallback if we don't get entries? 

We need all these planned out before going ahead. On your subpage, maybe, could you post an announcement for avatars? Idk. We need entries. 
Furthermore, depending on how many people join, 12 judges seem... More than a little extra. If you changed the number because of me or smthn, I'm totally okay with not judging. Even TCW, with 53 participants has only 5 judges; 4 alternating. So, it might not be feasible to have 12. We've also got to factor in the dreaded inactivity... o.o

Atop this, I have one more question. Are the points by team or individual members?

Edit: ACTUALLY, you know what we should do?! Along with the homepage challenge, make it a homepage AND avatar challenge! That'd be two birds with one stone, so to say! :D
We should give 'em team names and then make 'em come up with an avatar for them. But we should allow avatar submissions early. Or just keep them separate... Actually, I think I know what to do >:)
But would you rather I reroute them to your page for the avatar contest or have entries in mine? I think it might be best to do a combination of the two; if you get entries (you said you'd only gotten one, hence why I'm asking here as well XP), could you send them to me, so they're all in one area, or vice versa?

I'm sorry, it's extremely late here, I have no idea if anything I said made sense, I'll check back next in a coherent manner...
• DATE: 11/25/2022, 6:38:27 PM
Oh, random, and about 5 days late (judging this rn, actually, for TCW), but about the grey colour thing, you could save the colour as a variable and when trying to find the colour just use the variable instead.

```
var g = color (r, g, b [< fill these with the rgb colour value]);

[loads of code to otherwise inefficiently search through]

fill (g);
[shape code & whatever]
```

- I love the hazy feel behind the words
- The way the words curve and the placing and everything is perfectly done.

So a circle guy with eyes
Should I make multiple characters with different skin/hair/eye colours? 
(Cuz RPG, so players can choose their own characters)

And it's not that bad for midnight XD
I probably shouldn't be on here at 5 AM many days myself, though XD

I'll do the characters first (before the scenery) so you can work on the animations

Hmm...
Random question! (Or _thought_, I suppose, is more like it, lol...)

What was there before everything?
Nothing, right?
That means _nothing_ existed.
'Nothing' _can't_ exist, though.
So wouldn't that make 'nothing' a paradox?

...
Also, I'm thinking of making a self-portrait, what do you guys think?

Actually, out of curiosity, what do you guys think I look like?

I think it might be more of a primitive response. Ya know? When fish are feeling threatened, they contort their body into a c-shape, which automatically propels them up. Fish all the way down in the sea don't seem to have this ability; only surface-level fish. So if they do it, they automatically go into the air cuz that's how their body works. And like @ski and @brønte said, they might be able to find out the temperature or pressure change. Also, the fact they won't be able to breathe... 

IDK. Just a theory. Like humans getting goosebumps, just a flight-or-fight response.

What if dogs bring us back sticks cuz they think we like throwing them?

Do you like MBTI? I'm an INTJ :D

I will re-release it in a new program.
It will only get complete in one week or so.

Apologies, I will go and check right now :)
• DATE: 3/10/2023, 5:02:29 PM
It is incomplete; still a WIP :)

I won't extend the formal deadline, but I'll accept your project late with no penalty :)
• DATE: 3/4/2023, 11:03:22 AM
Make multiple for-loops :p
• DATE: 3/1/2023, 11:46:20 AM
The skill level really is pointless at this point, tbh, xD
But sure, I'll change it once I get the time if you want :)
• DATE: 2/12/2023, 9:09:50 AM
Yeah, they're not active. Sure, you can join! Mind if I put you in Caela? They really need active members, smh.
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 10:27:07 PM
Hmm, depending on how good it is, lol... I'd like to say perhaps 5 or so, though. I'm not sure how much the other judges know SQL; therefore, idk how they'll judge it. But I'll weigh them if they seem unfair (as ik some SQL) =)
The point of this challenge is to learn and if the result demonstrates that, the scores will reflect it :)
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 7:08:25 PM
Mate, you just got extra points for creativity from me :D
Definitely, go ahead =D

Yeah, definitely use other stuff, lol. There's only so much you can learn here, XD
• DATE: 2/1/2023, 5:29:34 AM
You submitted an entry for the Winter Challenge? I cannot see an entry of yours on the thread on my side; neither can Ace Rogers or the other judges. As to the Creative Challenge, judging has not yet commenced :)

In all honesty, there are very few things on KA showing how to make graphics, lol. I haven't even completed the courses, XD
But...
It's just like dragging shapes and vertices to form a shape, which makes a better shape, a better graphic. Throw in some loops and noise, et voila! You can also learn tons by observing the graphics of the legends: Daniel T, NitOwl, Green Ghost... :D

There is a thread in the T&T in which you can submit your program by sending me its link.
• DATE: 1/12/2023, 12:38:00 PM
As many as you can; the goal is to garner points for your team, so you need to participate in individual challenges to gain points. Whether or not that means _all_ of them  is up to you.
• DATE: 1/11/2023, 7:55:51 PM
I mean, for example, if you watch Frozen and copy Elsa, line for line, then yeah, most likely. But if you watch Frozen and just get _inspiration_ for a program, then probably not, unless it's clearly a poor rip-off.

The deadline is only so we have everything accounted for and don't go searching, but you can still edit it really as much as you need.
• DATE: 1/9/2023, 7:30:41 PM
You should do whatever season it is where you are. So, if you're in the northern hemisphere, winter, but if you're in the southern hemisphere, summer =P

It would deduct points (for originality and creativity).

It's a scene in a collab but unfinished; still a WIP. So I'd prefer it if you didn't vote =)
• DATE: 12/31/2022, 6:43:42 PM
It has not begun yet; it will start on the 2nd of January =)
• DATE: 12/25/2022, 6:06:55 PM
Using the distributive property, we can go from 
(fx + g)(hx + j) 
to 
(fh)x² + (fj + gh)x + gj

1. fx ⋅ hx = fhx².
2. fx ⋅ j = fjx.
3. g ⋅ hx = ghx.
4. g ⋅ j = gj.
At this point, we have all four... Segments, with lack of a better word... Of our expression written:
fhx² + fjx + ghx + gj
From here, we can factor out the x.
(fh)x² + (fj + gh)x + gj
Now, at the beginning of the video, we had the variables a and b. Let's replace the fj and gh with them.
a = fj
b = gh
Therefore, a ⋅ b will be equal to fj ⋅ gh, which we could then rewrite as fhgj, also equal to (fh)(gj).
Now, let's refer back to the first, unfactored expression we had:
fhx² + fjx + ghx + gj
Now that we have (fh)(gj), when looking back at the previous expression, we can see it is the first coefficient (fh) times the constant term (gj).
So, 
a [aka fj] + b [aka gh] = middle term [fj + gh]
Using the commutative property of multiplication, we can reorder the fjgh to see that
a [aka fj] ⋅ b [aka gh] = first coefficient ⋅ constant term
And this is why it all works out in the end.

Hope this helps!
(actually, I hope it's _coherent_ in the first place, lol XD)
• DATE: 12/17/2022, 3:16:44 PM
The competition starts on 2 Jan, but you can begin working on the challenges early =)
However, the thread to submit entries will only be opened on the day of the challenges' start.

No, these are just in-competition points; ones that I made up. The team with the most points at the end wins =)
_However,_ you _do_ gain energy points by actively being on KA and coding as well! :D
• DATE: 12/16/2022, 1:28:59 PM
Nope, it stands for Processing JavaScript, the highly inefficient (albeit great starting point) language KA uses. It's significantly different from Java Script and not used much in real life.

(why is that so funny XD)
• DATE: 12/12/2022, 5:51:05 PM
Ah, sorry, I didn't see this. It's mostly how they rated themselves, and I'm at least _somewhat_ trying to give everyone the teams they ask for, and that's kinda just how it ended up...

Sure! =)

Sure, but don't credit me. I got it from TDJ's subpage, and he'd gotten it from King, iirc.
• DATE: 12/7/2022, 3:42:41 PM
It specifies the render mode and makes it 2-dimensional (which is also default, but it must be specified whilst using `createGraphics`).
• DATE: 12/6/2022, 8:17:55 PM
Sure, you can do it on PJS if ya like! :D
• DATE: 12/6/2022, 11:21:23 AM
The basic HTML takes only, like, 30 minutes; HTML is a very simple language. Adding in the actual content, as opposed to lorem ipsum; let's say an hour. The CSS? Another hour. Let's throw in another half an hour for learning and double-checking; etc. So maybe 3 hours total. But I've been told I'm a fast coder, so idk.
• DATE: 12/6/2022, 9:53:48 AM
Yeah, I did. Eh, just some simple rhyming and turning mental ranting into something... Not-so-ranty lol.

You simply forgot to define variable t.
Just add
```var t = 0.01;```to the start, and it'll work like a charm :)

The thing is, I saw how you defined all the variables outside, in the 'variables' section, but that won't work, because the map is inside a named function, so the global variables don't have a scope inside 'em.
