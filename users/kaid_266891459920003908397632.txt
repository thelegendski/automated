Bueno, estar? bien, ?solo fue una equivocaci?n!
Um, well, if/when finals come up and you need help, I'll help you, lol, porque tu maestro no parece ser un buen instructor y necesitas hacer bien en al menos dos o tres a?os de una lengua para lucir bien para la universidad. O ?ya hiciste franc?s? 
(Google Translate what you don't understand, lol.)

**se?orita; se?ora is used as a form of address for old or married women, lol
...Just how pedantic am I to grammatically correct a series of three words?

Lol, oki :p

That's an odd request but sure :DD
(Hmm, is this in any way influenced by my bullet checklist to-dos for CoC, xD)

Only a year or so left, eh, Grandpa? 
Don't forget me when ya go, lol ;-;
Would you still be active?

A bit darker, but not too much, b'cuz of the ladder and gear colours that need to pop. But oki :))

Bonjour, Tyler! Je m'appele Marie!
(Why did I do that? Je ne sais pas.)
I am bored once more, lol. So, ofc, I'll just annoy you, and, ofc, just don't respond if you don't wanna :p

I need to get a life again b'cuz now my Tuesdays and Thursdays have opened a bit which sucks 'cuz I like actually having smthn to do; I'd die of boredom elsewise :pp

How's life?

On a slightly less tangential point, are there any particular backgrounds you want me to make for the CoC program? Maybe I can put this time to a bit of useless use. And portal gun or time machine? I already made a time machine, so idk if I should make both... =P

- ski.js is _running_ normal JS in HTML, but things I used in the code like `strokeWeight` aren't in 'normal JS', as you know; if you were rendering graphics using normal JS on an HTML5 canvas, it'd be `ctx.lineWidth`. I was talking about the game's code not being in normal JS, not ski.js not being in JS. That's obviously JS, lol.

- There's just a blank loading screen for, like, 45 seconds if it's `loopTimeout` by dkareh or KWC, and idk any others, so perhaps I'm mistaken. Ik there's `jshint:ignore` or `jsesnext:true` and those, but that's not what I meant, :p. If you toss in `type`, even if it's blank, in the `<script>` tag, there's never any wait or delay and it always works =p

- Is that legal?

@Jake K -
Not too familiar with them, but Ashkenazy. And have you heard their double concerto? I'm sure you have... o.o

Beethoven is amazing and _Moonlight Sonata_ is beautiful, although I wouldn't call it my favourite. _Symphony No 3_ is his best imo. Vivaldi's _4 Seasons_ is a stunning composition (my favourite is _Autumn_) and Chopin's _Fantaisie-Impromptu_ is insane, lol. I still like Rachmaninoff more overall :p

What's your favourite key?
I love G minor and F# minor.

Most KA users are American so my default goes there. Timezones match, somewhat. Most words are spelt using the American spelling.

I personally have an affinity toward Rachmaninoff; his Cello Sonata is absolutely amazing, probably my favourite piece (cellos and pianos ftw!). I also love Schumann. Actually, I love Romantic era music in general, although I wouldn't say I'm a fan of opera. Verdi is amazing, though. It's really nice to see other classical lovers :D

Well. There are 12 vowels and 18 letters, both of which can be used separately. And then 12 vowels ? 18 consonants to make more letters. Combo letters, ig. And then one unique letter that makes the consonants sound like i + [consonant]. There are also special letters (that I didn't count in the 247; they're called Grantha letters) that are really similar to Sanskrit, like ????, sri, and are used pretty much exclusively for writing English or Sanskrit in Tamil.
? > ka, consonant
? > aa, vowel
? + ? = ?? > ka + aa = kaa, but kaa is also just a letter
? + ? = ?? > ka + uhk = ik
? is only a half-letter, though, it can't be used elsewhere, except for one or two words like ????, meaning steel :p

That is painfully relatable xDDDD

That is not how it should look.
I know I'm using it only on the gradient and the gradient should not look like that. Check GH again for an example :)
I'm using posterize on the gradient and layering said gradient atop the menu. The gradient should still have posterize and I don't _want_ the rest to have posterize b'cuz that's stupid.

The gears are gonna be somewhat hidden anyways using a posterized gradient to make the text and buttons pop. Yellow on it would detract attention from the text in the foreground b'cuz yellow, being such a bright colour, naturally attracts the eye ;p

@Animation Guy -
B'cuz 50,000 calories per meal with 30,000 calories of snacks in between is downright insane and startlingly unhealthy. Perhaps you're mistaken in the count?

(My concern merely increases as the phrase "only 54 Oreo cookies" appears... "Only"... o.o)
54 Oreo cookies a day.
893 Oreo cookies a day.
What seems healthier? 
Your, ah, _method_ may give you more Oreo cookies but mine gives you more... You know... _Years alive_ xD

Think

...Also, yes, perhaps if they were Chips Ahoys as opposed to Oreos I would join you in eating that 893 xD

That'd be an ESTJ, then.
Rather surprised, lol. You don't seem like an ESTJ here, but ig idk you well enough on that :p
(And I'm not scary intelligent if I screwed the order that much xD)

Some people here are _super_ obvious to guess, though, lol.

Also, yay, someone else who knows smthn about cognitive functions on KA! =o
And, lol, I didn't memorise, but the method for finding cognitive functions after looking at a type is quite easy ;)
If the first letter is E, the third letter + E is the dominant (ex: ESTJ > T + E = Te). Auxiliary is the opposite extrovert/introvert for the second letter (es: ESTJ > Opposite of extrovert [thinking] is introvert. 2nd letter S. S + I = Si.). Tertiary is the opposite of auxiliary (ex: ESTJ > opposite of Si is Ne). Inferior is the opposite of dominant (ex: ESTJ > opposite of Te is Fi). See, easy! :D

Hmm.
Cognitive functions.
You have Fi, looks like.
That'd mean Te.
I don't think you have Ni, so Ne, which would be Si.
I cannot, however, decide the order of these functions...
Dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, inferior...
Looks like Ne dom. If it's Ne dom, it's aux Fi, tertiary Te, then Si inferior.
If you're anything irl like you are on here, you are an ENFP. Perhaps an INTP irl, but here, you appear to be an ENFP, or against my better judgement (confused 'bout high Fe, too; trickster function?), an ENFJ :)

(Although I've only seen one of 'em, maybe I'll dig through your projects later, lol.)
Why thank you! You actually have no idea how much that means lol :DDD
And yes, they're so easy. Even easier than `begin`/`endShape`, tbh, lol.

Ah, yeah. Improved my CSS, though; everything for the nav-bar (except showing active) is done using CSS! >:D
Yeah, I'll probs just leave 'em, lol.

Fix the sticky menu? Sorry xP

In a final sense, what information is not "useless"? What will truly help us? What will being able to "apply" it ever do? We're all heading to the same place in the end, lol, so what even... _Matters,_ really? I suppose only time will tell... You never know what's actually useless until you need it :p

Also, you have bragging rights for being my friend >;P
And for being the best savage ninja ever :D
...You're a fantastic person, yk, and you're the only one of you to ever exist, so you already have bragging rights for that, and you always, always, will ;)

Now wouldn't it be cool if we could clone not only ourselves, but also experiences?

2) That's 'cuz it's a `box-shadow`, lol. Line 304. Fixed now, is it better? :D
3) True, lol. Too lazy to change it rn tho, xD, but I'll definitely keep it in mind for next time :)
4) It seems to fit with the styling a 'lil better with both but maybe I'll change the 2nd one to posts =)

Ah! I doubt you'll find one like that ;)
Severely modified used `feCovolveMatrix` + `feDisplacementMap` and a kernel matrix; hardly recognisable at this point, I'd say :D

That's good to know, but sucks that it only works after you reload, smh xD

_Yes._ Chocolate is fantabulous and has surpassed the mortal sensations of temperature acuity  :o. Therefore, you _must_ have hot cocoa. 'Tis necessary :ooo
Yw! You're _you, ofc_ you will! :D
Ah, oki. (You're _sure_ you're name's not Tyler, Wyatt, or Warren? xD)

Welp.
You did.
And it was funny. 
:p

Yay c:
(For once I'm more than annoying, =O)

:D
You can always try...
Even if it's half as good, tho, it'll still be tremendously entertaining, _lol_
(think of this as relaxing after you finish whatever you need to do for the CoC program lol :p)

This should be fine, ig. On line 126, though, it's annoying me a bit, can you change `this.h - 1.5` to `this.h - 2.5`? I forgot it has to be 1/2 the radius, not strokeWeight xP

Also, take away the stroke for the arrow.

(I'm sorry.
Idk who to talk to.
You're awesome <3)
Life? Insane. Absolutely insane. Stressed to the max, but I can't show it. Crazy number of stuff going on. Suddenly feel super alone; really miss some people I used to know. But I've always been an independent person, so gotta grind my way out. Gonna have to travel again for three months, gonna have guests, schoolwork is utterly psychotic, and I am taking the optional credit exam and college-level sciences for a future chance at a scholarship via a huge national, heck, _international_ competition. Yet I feel like a moron; ik I can do better, but also, life is meant to be lived and getting a PhD like my 16 yo cousin is not what I plan to do. Look around irl and I still feel _somewhat_ smart; take a look on KA, and there's my fellow friend taking 5 college classes at 15-16. Oh, and music concerts in between all that. I suppose CoC, too, but that's not particularly the highest priority. Finished my part for round 2 ages ago, but my collab partner is not done with his part. 
Essentially, gonna break, generally dead, but... It's not the worst it could be, I suppose :)

1. Coloured dots? That sounds a 'lil lame, ngl lol.
How about a message written in low-opacity letters on the wall as "invisible" ink for the 2nd easy challenge? The first might just be unlocking the door with a key or smthn lol. One of them could be there's a piece of paper laying around and when the robber gets close, a message opens up with 4 riddles on it: 

"Answer these, and the number each term holds
will show you the pin as your escape unfolds.

What can run but can't walk? 
[river > 5]
What has a neck but no head? 
[shirt > 5]
What goes up but never comes down? 
[age > 3]
What flies without wings?
[time > 4]

[pin: 5534]"

Or smthn like that :D

Another level could just be like the classic platformer, escaping the guards' shooting. Another could be an easy anagram: teh rnasew si en-ohuotasnd, horufnu-dder, xi-sytereht. 
(The answer is 1463 :p)

Another could be the Fibonacci pattern: 
The first 4 positive numbers from this formula commonly found in nature: 
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
...I think that's the right formula, lol... o.o

Idk.
Maybe?
Idk how hard all of this will be to implement, so maybe not...

2. Idrk, maybe vertexes instead of lines and then mask the block shapes inside that? As to positioning, I presume you can't change the `x, y` part of the image? Not a clue, lol.

3. It's underground? Oki then. The bricks are now light blue. They'll go well with the dark blue brick background for the parallax feel :P

4. Done with that, I think. Do the transitions suck? Tried to make 'em like police lights XP
Also made the dead scene ;p

Could you make something like `textLeading` in ski.js? =P
Not now, maybe later, but that'd be nice to have. 
Atm, it's a fair bit too small; the... Smush-iness... Looked a 'lil odd on both _brave_ and the current _Antihero_. Or is there already a way my dumb butt doesn't know of...? Can we use `line-height` from CSS somehow?

Also, did you do a bit of a clean-up with your projects? :p

When the dude stands next to them, they get bigger and then you enter the key code you find using clues in the room and type/punch in the combination and they open? Or maybe nothing at all that fancy and they just take a key nearby and plug it in and the jail door opens :p
Sure!
(I'll edit this back again, but could you send me a reference on GH b'cuz idrk what you mean by block graphics; like any particular textures [like the bricks I made earlier?] or...?)
Oki =)
Yeah, I'll add a transition ofc and maybe a sine rectangle background (like the thing on the team ninjaz logo part of that project [and I'll edit this thing out too lol])? I'd steal your particles but that's also...  Stealing... Your particles... Lol. 
I've also gotta fix the menu button's position, now that looks awful, lol.

Great =D

Perfect! :D

So ya see how all the way at the bottom, I made this function?
It ofc works like a classic for loop in PJS for repeated circles or whatever. But now I want the circles to append to different pages. Obviously, the child will just move if you call it again in a different div, but I want it to appear on both pages, without cloning to maintain the versatility =P
And I can't and Google is useless b'cuz anything similar involves cloning which isn't what I want, smh. I'll probs just release it and work on it later, else I'll never end up finishing lol.
```
        const circs = (/* page,*/ size, clx, cly, x, y, strk, fil, wl, wh, space/*, what */) => {
            for (let i = 0; i < wl; i += size * space) {
                for (let j = 0; j < wh; j += size * space) {
                    let circle = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "circle");
        
                    circle.setAttribute("cx", clx + i);

                    circle.setAttribute("r", size);
                    circle.setAttribute("stroke", strk);
                    circle.setAttribute("fill", fil);
                    
                    svg.setAttribute("viewBox", "0 0 600 500");

Anyways, though, after they finish transferring, _none_ of the endpoints will be accessible from the KA CS projects (legally, at least) b'cuz CORS doesn't allow it. (Basically, no, not really. No usable endpoints.)

Oh, so we're gonna add the arms separate from the character function images? So the main characters are images but their limbs move using oop (if they have to pick up guns and do stuff)...?

So `image (graphics.[char], x, y, [width], [height])` but that only has the body + head, and then limbs that move using `lerp` and `sin` or whatever...?

Idk if this makes sense, sorry XP

Oh, so you're thinking a weapon game where the guy shoots the gun and breaks out of the prison. I was thinking smthn more logic-heavy. Welp, they both sound good, although the shooting thing's a classic, so we might get more points for creativity.

Huh, if we're using guns but making them full-rigged, I suppose we're gonna need to animate individual joints.
And if we make them fully-rigged instead of the classic floaty-arms, we'll need to use OOP instead of literally translating images, right?

Oh, so you're thinking a weapon game where the guy shoots the gun and breaks out of the prison. I was thinking smthn more logic-heavy. Welp, they both sound good, although the shooting thing's a classic, so we might get more points for creativity.

Huh, if we're using guns but making them full-rigged, I suppose we're gonna need to animate individual joints.

Great :D
Agreed.
Which weapons? No guns, I presume, b'cuz _KA._ 
Control panels, oki, any particular size? I suppose we can always scale, but yeah. Any keys? To pick the first lock and escape? That can be the easy ones, the first level or so, and the doors get harder as they go. Harder ones like an escape room, with having to guess the right passcodes. Sorta like a mix between a platformer-ish-thing and a logic game, ig. Maybe?

Blocks? Like bricks? For a wall or smthn?

Oki, I'll make 'em better :D

So, what _else_ is there to do? The homepage is mostly done, the only thing left is to change the content of the buttons, add the titles/some text, and shading, which won't take long at all. Now it's probably time for the main gameplay. _The Chase_ and _Breakout,_ right? So the robber's escaping jail. How should we go about that? :P
The logic's all yours, ofc. So any particular graphics you need? =P

Eep...
Apologies, but could you make a spinoff with the fixes? XP
Idk what you mean by "the argument 0" (`rectMode(0)`?) or which collision function (my one that's commented out or yours at the start of the program) or even why the draw worked b'cuz the `menuScene` had no content; it was all commented out, but the code worked, ish. The characters didn't show up, though.

How's the stuff looking, btw?

I got a 6.6 from JLE v(0-0)v
And then I asked why kinda annoyingly and subsequently got told off by Liam (which I needed tho, ngl) XD
So wonderful S. M. V. has gotten on the bad side of the judges lol

I'm currently revamping my subpage too; been meaning to do so for a while :P

And I'm quite happy I figured out how to loop SVGs c:
And I've made that into callable functions =P
Although the pages they're supposed to show up on aren't working, all of it is appending on the last-called page, so now I've gotta beg Mr Italics and pro gong player and bread for help lol
And the es6 page switch that was working 3 hours ago decided not to work and idk why, smh. But es5 is working, so... v(0-0)v

How's life?

Can you help me with the buttons? Why aren't they changing colour as the mouse hovers above them?
Sorry XP
(ooo but they are classes :D)

Here:
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/6051327054757888

(btw, I have finished the characters, now I'm making a car and everything else better + easily usable

Although can we make the characters, like, not have legs XD
They look _really_ weird with them :P
Fits the style better w/out
And hovering arms
I originally did the sine walking thingy but it looked _weird_

And I suppose we can't include guns because _ThINK Of thE chILdrEN_ :o
Did you know those were called Studly caps? I just got bored and decided to make a horrible program that makes it like that a couple days ago :P)

----

_Edit:_
Still can't get that to work, but now why are the loaded images in the graphic object not having a cleared background? And even when it's an image, the random is going crazy (saving it separately didn't make it go insane). 
I'm sorry, this must make 0 sense XP
But it's in the link above =P

I read a lot, lol. We never learn particle physics in school, unfortunately =(
What are you guys learning in your physics? (pls don't be forces, smh, that's so boringgg)

=)
Ohh, that depends on what you wanna see. Like... City or nature, for example. Def take a visit to Cornwall, it's gorgeous! Idk how to surf, but the beaches are epic! Also, Seven Sisters park in Sussex is stunning! :D
For cities, Oxford is really pretty (and take a visit to London, too, ofc) and if ya go to Ireland, I love Dublin (really, the flight itself to Ireland is stunning [although we'd a private flight so the pilot was very lax and took a detour to show some really beautiful sights]).

My grammar was incorrect, apologies :)
Technically, stuff is uncountable, though, as the plural for stuff is not 'stuffs' but still 'stuff' :P

Yup!
Oh, that's a good idea.

We don't _have_ letter grades :p
Although if you have a 93 + average the entire school year, you're on the A honour roll.
I'd say "yes" but that'd imply we're smart in the first place.
...I'm... I'm ah, not in Australia... o.O
We're tested at a young age and they identify you as G/T (or both like moi :p) and give you different classes/make you go to a different school. Although what I have is still stupid easy and I will rant for ages on its idiocy b'cuz I took a diagnostic (questions change based on skill level) and got up to Calculus (mostly multivariable calc and inner products of vectors), but ykw we're doing in class? _Systems of equations._ I fell asleep during maths and almost missed the bell, lol.

Oof XD
I think by "life" I just mean stuff to do lol
I've a credit exam the 17th, a competition the 18th, a plethora of quizzes/minor exams (like 12), 2 more midterms left, an essay, orchestra chair placements, a school dance I've gotta figure out how to avoid going to, meeting up at my friend's house to possibly build another bridge for the competition, a friend's b-day party, maybe actually study (who knows? _Perhaps_), another person's b-day, and... I think that's it.

Hi!
How'd ya do on 'em? :D
Aw, welp. I feel ya m8 :/

Eh, I'm fine, thanks for asking =) 
Feb's a very busy month! Had a midterm, a maths exam, and an essay today. Chemistry test yesterday; class average was a 62% o.o 
I got a 97.1% so not bad; missed a single question and that's 'cuz I misclicked (...And didn't recheck my answers lol). Although, everyone < 80% fails b'cuz it's a "gifted & talented" school (beg to differ; we're all morons) so... Yeah. Many other stuff coming up this month, yay, I've a life for once =P

**scoffs** imagine _not_ having such a lack of a life that among your favourite forms of entertainment are changing bios **cough**
I changed it just before I saw this comment and idk what it was before anymore, lol. Kinda messed up a bit earlier on KA by "pestering" the CoC judges (- courtesy of Liam, lol, but I was curious as to why I lost points. And then didn't receive an answer, even when ik the person saw the notif. Seems a 'lil fishy if one takes off points and doesn't [can't?] explain why... In retrospect, ig I should've fought more but ehhh I'd just get even more on their bad side. Deleted the comments =P) XD

I'd hate to overload you, but is there any way you could make `randomSeed();` in ski.js? Or am I a moron (like I usually am) and is there a way to stop this without that?

This is why; lines 147-149.

Oh, dear. Take a nice, long nap after, eh, m8?
Or, ya know, get a web dev. The balance will be skewed when HS gets kicked. 2 graphics, 2 game, 1 webpage. Balance :P
A hybrid game-web dev is the best choice, but with a lack of such, _[js object for completion/failure of an async op and its value]_ is perfect for this: decent and has not been selected yet. She can even get in some graphics if need be, perhaps. Just my thoughts, ofc, as always, final decision is yours, cap!

Do you have Linux on that Chromebook? 
If you didn't already, running command might help you:
```
$ ls /[directory name]
$ ls -a
$ ls -lt
```

Or if it was backed up on a PC, dir command inside `cmd.exe`

`C:\> dir /o-d`

should also help you with that.

Do you have Linux on that Chromebook? 
If you didn't already, running command might help you:
```
$ ls /[directory name]
$ ls -a
$ ls -lt
```

Baking powder's the stuff that makes baked stuff rise lol
I'd be a 'lil concerned if that's what you put in your hot cocoa XD
Yeah. Awful. Idk what they do, it's disgusting and tasteless 
>=(

Well...
What if you go to repositories and sort by most recently updated? If you updated it last at midnight yesterday, that'd say smthn like "updated 17 hours ago" and you'd be able to see which one it is...? A private repo updated 17 hours ago. And then go from there? I presume you'd have already tried that, but... XP
Wait, it _is_ on GH, right?
Good :)
"idk what a computer is" _lol_

Idk if you have it in America, but just 100% pure baking cocoa from the brand _______ (if I tell you, you'd figure out where I live [and considering the fact you went onto a global weather website after hearing the temperature here, I wouldn't put it far past ya lol]). But definitely not a premade powder; those _suck._ Always need that S. M. V. touch, ya know? Strong (but not too strong!) on the cocoa, slightly on the lower side for sugar (compliments the "accessories" like whipped cream [although I didn't have a very fancy hot cocoa :p]). The _perfection_ ya can't find in a store-bought powder >=P

:D
Can't blame 'em, but yeah, it'd be quite sad.
_Wow..._ Idrk you but that sounds _exactly_ like smthn you'd do, lol XD

As some brilliant person enunciated on _ski.js basix:_ "And the color... wow! It's like a light shade of lime, but more mellow and soft. And the white background gives it a good look."

In mine, it really does :P

Eh, curve vertexes seem like too much work if the result looks exactly like a rectangle with dots on its sides lol
Maybe a 'lil bit of inner detailing; a shadow or smthn, for the bedspread, too. Looks too simple. Definitely not bad, but maybe class it up (after finishing the base graphics in time, ofc, that's the most important part)
The rug looks cool tho :D
Well, I mean, yeah, you're right, just normal, but def not bad. Besides, you can't get particularly detailed with books. (**proceeds to make hyper-realistic but also cartoon book** _unless you're me, ofc_ >:3) If you want real, _savage_ criticism, like yours of my WCC webpage, try makin' a just graphic sometime :p

Yes, ofc, b'cuz I'm such a nice human being that way, right >:)))

Oh, wow, _cool!_ :D
Well, in all honesty... Over summer, I randomly found out I'd gotten un-childed, made a rickroll, felt bad it got on the HL, and then finally decided to make graphics because I'm too dumb for games (although ofc I'm planning on getting better and moving to more complicated stuff) XD

That's one of the fantastic things about ski.js: _fonts!_ (@ski can you hire me as marketing manager for ski.js lol) Like in an HTML program, you just import the font in a link in the head, and then when specifying the font as you would in a PJS program, use the imported font.
Ex:
```
[foo]
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Garamond'rel='stylesheet'>

[foo]
<script>
    textFont(createFont("Garamond");
    text("heyo, :D! i'm mr savage ninja and i agree that S. M. V. is the best nicknamer in the world ;p", 10, 10, 300, 300);
</script>```
The text above will be in the font Garamond :D

Yup =/

Yup, the canvas API is where the graphics are drawn in JS and HTML.

ski.js is a library very similar to PJS. 
(Actually, even PJS is a library =P)
This project has an example of ski.js: https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/5422324483932160

Nah, not really. An example is instead of:
`var thing = function (x, y) {return x * y};`
you can do:
```const thing = (x, y) => {return x * y};`

My ninja program is PJS, yeah. Unfortunately whilst converting, my laptop had to do a mandated restart and I lost a ton of progress so I just kept it in PJS (I'd done it there and then converted).

Edit:
Oh, oops, looks like ski and I posted at the same time XP

Sometimes, there's really no meaning behind some stuff. Entropy always increases, right? It's like the chaos just built up to a point and then they do stupid stuff for no reason at all. Asking them is pointless. Adrenaline rush. Nothing was "wrong", they just _wanted_ to do it.
It's not anger, it's being human, then.
It's not anger to try and help someone get their grade up whilst keeping yours at a hundred. It's making them do what they _should_ be doing and motivating them. 
I hate false words of love because they're _never_ true. 
Tell me I suck and I'll get better. Tell me I'm good and I won't even try.

If you didn't get angry, where's the line between right and wrong going to be drawn? Laws exist to smooth down righteous anger. If there was no anger, why have laws? Why have stop signs, right? Oh, someone will die because the cars will crash into each other... But if people just got sad and not mad, not _angry,_ they wouldn't bother gaining justice; they'd just accept it and move on. The problem will never be fixed. Really, without anger, society is nothing. We would be at a point where nothing progresses. We _need_ it. 
We can't "forgive" someone if we are unable to recognise the mistake. How do we recognise a mistake? Because it makes someone angry. And that anger is justified. 
Forgiveness cannot come without sin and sin cannot be encountered without fury.

I'm not going to say anything about the rest of your message nor promote a discussion on religion on a learning website :P

Forgiveness cannot come without sin and sin cannot be encountered without fury.

I'm not going to say anything about the rest of your message nor promote a discussion on religion on a learning website :P

Huh... Guess so, XD

You definitely should have! It was epic! And freezing... But epic! :DDD

Well, I didn't =P
No, I'm an idiot :P

Well, of course it was the first thing; it's the startup, :P
But they are not good. Definitely need to improve that, lol.

Actually, snails and slugs evolved differently so even if you forcefully remove the shell from a snail, it's technically not a slug :P
Both are gastropods, though, and the basic separation is those without shells are slugs and those with shells are snails, so yeah :P

Dull lol no
That's what I was saying! You can control anger. But if you cease to get angry then you just won't be able to achieve something. Like if you're in a group and some people are just not doing anything, you have a right to express your anger (_without_ shouting at them) and make 'em do their work. If you don't get angry, would you tell them that? No. Why would you bother? You'd be _perfectly_ fine getting a 60 on the assignment, no? Anger is necessary _and_ healthy :p

Yup.
If you don't get angry at all, if their breaking all your stuff didn't make you mad, why would you patiently talk to them? Everything is perfect, right? You're not mad about anything! So why'd you bother talking to them in the first place?

:P

Yeah, the world sucks

"attention to detail"

blob arm that someone's already called out as lookin' like a slug, XD
But thank you :p
Also, do you know what the Japanese characters say? >;)))

It's not working without it; it draws it for like a second before playing the rest of the scenes; why?

600 x 600 so won't scale well for a wallpaper, though, right, lol
And if I ever decide to make these those things of which I cannot recall the name but people pay money for these graphics online... What are they called again... On the tip of my tongue... Aurghh

What's your favourite KA graphic?
Mine's _Starlight Sonata,_ probably =P

Still pointless ;p
If you get more comfortable whilst angry, you calm down faster, too. Less suppression. You don't blow up. Your fuse last longer.
Let's say your annoying 'lil sibling and his friend unlocked your room and jumped on your wardrobe and broke it and now clothes are strewn across your room and then they tore a bunch of awesome paintings/drawings from the walls and then mutilated a 'lil design your friend made for you. I mean, I still have a choice, but without a slightly angry reprimand, if nobody _else_ does anything, you kinda have to =/
Why the heck... No, lol. I'm trying to defend that it's okay to get angry at times, though.

It is stupid, lol. I've found a fair number of people can pull it off. The most important thing is voice _tone_ :p
Not getting comfortable! Now that is definitely not good! You just shouldn't suppress your anger b'cuz then it'll all blow up at some point, lol.
"Aurrghhhhhh, I'm so mad at [...] b'cuz [...]" or smthn. "Can you please not do that? You're makin' me kinda angry!" Idk.

It doesn't necessarily. I sing solo, anyways, but in a choir, some high parts sound kinda nice like that if you manage to pull it off.
You don't need to get angry. Just be able to healthily show it if you do, ya know? Not saying I get angry often, rather the opposite, but if need be, I should be able to feel comfortable expressing it :P

Idk American football at all, so no comment :p
Never taken piano lessons, either (self-taught), so again, no comment.
Okay, this one is actually stupid. There's nothing really wrong singing with your head. It's like a different style. With your chest is really uncomfortable for some people (your diaphragm expands a lot). Now, with the chest sounds fuller. But both of these are actually wrong; you should sing from, like, your stomach, really. The sound should come from lower in your body for the best, richest sound.
Get angry, don't show it. Still kinda stupid, though; for a healthy relationship, one should be able to express their feelings openly (< me being a hypocrite, lol).
Get angry, don't show it (x2 :p).

*News: Creative Challenge*

Hi, all! The Winter Challenge is almost over (only a few hours left!) and results _should_ be posted by midnight, GMT, Friday or Saturday. One quick note: the captain of Hydrus has been changed; Timothy is now cap'n (as TDJ is inactive for the time being).

A thread to submit the Creative Challenge has been opened; entries will be accepted until the 6th of February.  Late entries/those not submitted under the entry thread will not be judged.

Again, you can put WIPs in the thread =P

As a reminder (gettin' a 'lil redundant, no?), for all challenges, judging will include the following criteria:
- Originality & creativity > bonus points for humour, quips, stories ;P
- Theme
- Efficiency > an exorbitant number of unnecessary lines may lower your score
- Code cleanliness > looking for commenting, proper indentation, etc
- Aesthetics > graphics, colour scheme

Entries will be judged out of 10 points.
You will be fairly weighted by skill level (oki, by this, I mean effort :p).

As always, good luck! :D

I've also been doing a _lot_ of stuff outside of KA, too (better HTML/CSS, 3D rendering, reviewing hashing [more of in crypto as opposed to, like, URL hashes] + encryption/encoding + decryption/decoding [even got a Friendly Hacker sun badge for that here :D]), but unlike my sib, I don't share it unless it's good, complicated, not on KA, or I've been stuck for the past three days and Google is not helping, so I _need_ to ask for help (smh-).

Hmm? I hate stupid, pointless rules, therefore, I will not abide stupid, pointless rules. Rules are meant to be broken ;)
Besides, CoC 1st pick, can't let my team/cap'n down =)
Also, grey areas are my best friend :D

_Awww_, now _that's_ a freakin' _adorable_ character, just look at that teeny smile, awww, fantastic job! The only critique I'd say is the feet look too pointy; perhaps round 'em off a 'lil? Also, how will the chap climb up the ladder? Maybe make arm movement dudez, too?

- `b.split("")` is entirely unnecessary
- `random` doesn't work outside of here which is why I used `Math.random()` :p

I know I'm late, but you literally copied someone else's code, changed a few colours, and then added ellipses onto the right eye. I do not at _all_ believe this deserves 27 votes (1/3rd of the original), but I am not going to flag it. However, the next time you _conveniently_ forget to make a spinoff, you'll most certainly get flagged, so _please_ give due credit; putting a link at the top _does not count_ as such. If you can find the time to copy and paste into a new program, surely you're capable of finding the juicy blue button at the bottom-right of the program titled "Spin-off"? 

Remember: don't code for votes. Code for yourself. Code to improve. Oki? Good luck :)

It could use a 'lil colour tho, the background's an easy fix for that, maybe make it blue instead of grey?
It'd be better with a 'lil more juicing, as Longtreader said. Also a menu page and the like would help :p

(...If it's currently sucky, it'll _have_ to stop sucking b'cuz you'll eventually be left with the weird stick thingy that you _can't_ suck so you'll have to get another lolly to suck but then things are sweet again :p)

I am clearly not a judge, but I _can_ see your comment with the scores. Not Timothy's or IA's, though. Although, yours didn't come in the notifs (I may or may not have subbed to this, lol); I wonder why...

Hihihihiii

You must be tired of all that fantastic ski-coding goin'  on so I'll just be here to give you company (...and possibly end up distracting you in which case just don't answer my annoying butt :P)

To make you feel a 'lil better, some good news, you've regained your nickname, mr-savage-ninja-legendary-pro-gong-player-elsa! 
(...Oki, whilst that would have absolutely not made you feel better, comedic relief, at least, _amirite?_ Ig you'd have been coding for like an hour and a half, so have some hot cocoa or smthn and don't overload yourself, mate >;P)

Ah, interesting.
May I ask why we _want_ a beginner?
"2 graphic dev, 3 game devs, 1 beginner"

And why no other web devs? 
You'd said everybody might be going out of their comfort zone (or something along those lines) earlier on GH, so if there were more webpages to be made, perhaps another person decent at that instead of a beginner?

Sorry, I must be very annoying right now (and honestly in general, eh, mr savage ninja) to be questioning your decisions. Trust ya enough to at least _hope_ you know what you're doing, just curious as to the reasoning behind it =P

ski is the only returnin' CoC captain an' beat the rest of KA as the winner of CoC's first round last year. there's only one legend.

ski is lookin' for those who are willin' to grind day in an' day out an' possess great talent an' skill. those who aren't afraid to lose an' wish to learn more than win. ski believes cooperation an' unity are crucial to success.

my vote:
recreational recreations an' nightmares & dreams."

You replaced the trees! :D
Although, you should probably take off cool guy coding's name saying he made 'em, XD

Also, on line 138, could you replace it with `ellipse (random (100, 180) + random(25)*sin(frameCount*random(5)), random (200, 20), rndm, rndm);`?  Sorry XP

**aggressively spam-clicks to watch sword go _boing**_
Lookin' good! 
The tree trunks are rather disproportionate, though. And inefficiently done.
=/

Here, replace the inside of the tree function with:
```
    pushMatrix();
    scale(s/80);
    translate(x, y);
    
    noStroke();
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 30; i+= 10) 
    {
        fill (0 + i*3, 0, 0);
        rect (100 + i, 140, i, 208);
    }
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) 
    {
        var rndm = random(20, 80);
        fill (0, 100 + i*0.8, 0);
        ellipse (random (100, 180)+random(5)*sin(frameCount*random(5)), random (200, 20), rndm, rndm);
    }
    
    popMatrix();
```
and then add `randomSeed(1);` to the draw function and tell me what ya think... =P

Is this the collab you and DR are doing? =P
Looks cool :D
(Random thought... Ya know how the dirt blocks' lines look like they say RM? What if you change the vertexes [lines 296-309] to smthn looking like your logo? Instead of RM, maybe DR x LG? Idk if that makes sense, but... :p)

_The good stuff:_
Not bad! The nav-bar opening is nice, as are the page fade-in animations =)

_Critiques (sorry, but had to be done XP):_
- Why are the images completely unrelated to the content? 
(Ex: trees for internet, volcano for airplanes, snow for slinkies, beach for microwaves, another volcano for biscuits, grass for robots, and a galaxy for computers)
- On the nav-bar, the words only show up if you hover _directly_ over them. It's honestly very awkward and not very user-friendly.
- The fonts. 'Nuff said. They're... Not good, to say the least.
- On the learning page, whilst hovering over them, they become half transparent and that also looks very awkward. It's also a little confusing, as I expected to be taken to another page if I click it (which is what one would think with a hover animation. Or perhaps I'm just an idiot... v(0-0)v)

This looks really nice! My skin is a bit more tan, maybe `rgb(217, 140, 102);`, so the face's stroke would be `rgb(207, 130, 91);` perhaps =P
The [my? lol] hair looks amazing! Ya nailed the colour :D

...I also look way more chaotic and would not be caught dead in a dress [black coat and jeans/black leggings ftw!] but if I were to go all fancy, yeah, I'd look like that o.o
Also, the dress colour is fantastic)

On the individual programs, could you possibly scale them up a bit? Like, `scale(1.5);` and then with the necessary translation. Thanks!

Hi! 
Sorry, I'm a bit of a moron, lol.
You've won for Caela! Amazing job! And for Pruina!
But... As the colours don't contrast with the background, could you make the `background (0, 0);`? Don't worry, you don't need to change anything about the avatars... They're looking great! I'm going to change the background of the images whilst inserting them into the page so they contrast a bit, enough to see well. Idk if this makes any sense, and I'm really sorry for the confusion (wow, I'm a horrible host lol), but could you set the background as that for all the avatars?

_Same rules apply as 1st thread._

...
Note: If you join this thread, be prepared for a _lot_ of notifications XP

...
*A quick disclaimer for fl@g-happy people*
_Technically, this is not violating any rules._

They are as follows:

"Fl@g as abuse
disrespectful or offensive, an advertisement

Fl@g as a question
Should be in ?Questions?

Fl@g as not helpful
Low quality, not about the video topic, soliciting votes or seeking badges, a homework question, repeatedly making the same post

Fl@g as about the site
A question about Khan Academy (e.g. ?What software does Sal use??), a post about badges, a technical problem with the site, a request for videos or features"

_Although certain parts of this thread go off-topic, it clearly does not violate anything above._

Furthermore, in the guidelines it says:
"...Social groups or clubs, or projects that generate social chats, and other posts not related to coding, in the discussion thread..."

_This is regarding the project getting hidden on the HL. This is -not- on the HL. No problem there!
Neither the guidelines nor fl@gs explicitly state anything to do with off-topic discussion *threads* so it can all be left up to viewer interpretation, making it somewhat easy to argue oneself out of a possible mess..._ >;D

Okay. We need a 'teams' page. It was a little confusing to read this, and when I'm converting this to a webpage (adding the main content rn), I think it's pretty much necessary to have all the information complete XP

Just give me these and I'll fill in the rest. 
- How many teams are there? 
- What are their names? 
- Are we really doing this avatar contest? 
- What is our fallback if we don't get entries? 

We need all these planned out before going ahead. On your subpage, maybe, could you post an announcement for avatars? Idk. We need entries. 
Furthermore, depending on how many people join, 12 judges seem... More than a little extra. If you changed the number because of me or smthn, I'm totally okay with not judging. Even TCW, with 53 participants has only 5 judges; 4 alternating. So, it might not be feasible to have 12. We've also got to factor in the dreaded inactivity... o.o

Atop this, I have one more question. Are the points by team or individual members?

Edit: ACTUALLY, you know what we should do?! Along with the homepage challenge, make it a homepage AND avatar challenge! That'd be two birds with one stone, so to say! :D
We should give 'em team names and then make 'em come up with an avatar for them. But we should allow avatar submissions early. Or just keep them separate... Actually, I think I know what to do >:)
But would you rather I reroute them to your page for the avatar contest or have entries in mine? I think it might be best to do a combination of the two; if you get entries (you said you'd only gotten one, hence why I'm asking here as well XP), could you send them to me, so they're all in one area, or vice versa?

I'm sorry, it's extremely late here, I have no idea if anything I said made sense, I'll check back next in a coherent manner...

Oh, random, and about 5 days late (judging this rn, actually, for TCW), but about the grey colour thing, you could save the colour as a variable and when trying to find the colour just use the variable instead.

```
var g = color (r, g, b [< fill these with the rgb colour value]);

[loads of code to otherwise inefficiently search through]

fill (g);
[shape code & whatever]
```

Oh, this is stunning! C'est _tres_ bien! Et... Parlez vous francais?

My favourite part is honestly probably the balcony's railings and the tree's leaves, as well as pretty much the intricacy. Although, for the future, it would probably be more efficient to put the background building in a loop :P 
Awesome job, again!

The lyrics, though, they got me in a twist.

This is absolutely, amazingly, stunningly, jaw-dropping. I know I'm certainly late to the party; by half a year, lol, but I'm still gonna give a full description of the awesomeness:

- The textures in the clothing are fantastic. The trousers' shading is super realistic, and the jacket... **chef's kiss**
- The background is also awesome!
- I love the hazy feel behind the words
- The way the words curve and the placing and everything is perfectly done.
- _The logo. The webs. The shoes. The hands. Everything!_ Un-be-lie-vable o.o

You could earn some big bucks doing this for a video game company or something :P

Once again, amazing job!

Wow, that's good! =D

I do have one comment though- for the sake of efficiency, instead of coding out every single vertex, it might be easier to use a for loop, especially for the more intricate parts :P

(You probably don't want to change all this hard work atm, but maybe for next time...? Idk.)

Hi there!

We're actually doing a collab. We ended up kinda... Flexing to each other, in a way, and he asked for some more info on some things, so yea, I kinda overloaded ig.

So a circle guy with eyes
Should I make multiple characters with different skin/hair/eye colours? 
(Cuz RPG, so players can choose their own characters)

And it's not that bad for midnight XD
I probably shouldn't be on here at 5 AM many days myself, though XD

I'll do the characters first (before the scenery) so you can work on the animations

Random question! (Or _thought_, I suppose, is more like it, lol...)

What was there before everything?
Nothing, right?
That means _nothing_ existed.
'Nothing' _can't_ exist, though.
So wouldn't that make 'nothing' a paradox?

...
Also, I'm thinking of making a self-portrait, what do you guys think?

Actually, out of curiosity, what do you guys think I look like?

I think it might be more of a primitive response. Ya know? When fish are feeling threatened, they contort their body into a c-shape, which automatically propels them up. Fish all the way down in the sea don't seem to have this ability; only surface-level fish. So if they do it, they automatically go into the air cuz that's how their body works. And like @ski and @br?nte said, they might be able to find out the temperature or pressure change. Also, the fact they won't be able to breathe... 

IDK. Just a theory. Like humans getting goosebumps, just a flight-or-fight response.

What if dogs bring us back sticks cuz they think we like throwing them?

Do you like MBTI? I'm an INTJ :D

- This is ski.js, btw, not normal JS in HTML :p
- Everything is much more efficient and we can _actually_ get rid of Oh Noes :)
- We can import stuff using the `script` tag
- _Fonts! Legally!_ :D

All in all, many advantages, and good question =)

In all honesty, there are very few things on KA showing how to make graphics, lol. I haven't even completed the courses, XD
But...
It's just like dragging shapes and vertices to form a shape, which makes a better shape, a better graphic. Throw in some loops and noise, et voila! You can also learn tons by observing the graphics of the legends: Daniel T, NitOwl, Green Ghost... :D

Using the distributive property, we can go from 
(fx + g)(hx + j) 
to 
(fh)x? + (fj + gh)x + gj

1. fx ? hx = fhx?.
2. fx ? j = fjx.
3. g ? hx = ghx.
4. g ? j = gj.
At this point, we have all four... Segments, with lack of a better word... Of our expression written:
fhx? + fjx + ghx + gj
From here, we can factor out the x.
(fh)x? + (fj + gh)x + gj
Now, at the beginning of the video, we had the variables a and b. Let's replace the fj and gh with them.
a = fj
b = gh
Therefore, a ? b will be equal to fj ? gh, which we could then rewrite as fhgj, also equal to (fh)(gj).
Now, let's refer back to the first, unfactored expression we had:
fhx? + fjx + ghx + gj
Now that we have (fh)(gj), when looking back at the previous expression, we can see it is the first coefficient (fh) times the constant term (gj).
So, 
a [aka fj] + b [aka gh] = middle term [fj + gh]
Using the commutative property of multiplication, we can reorder the fjgh to see that
a [aka fj] ? b [aka gh] = first coefficient ? constant term
And this is why it all works out in the end.

Hope this helps!
(actually, I hope it's _coherent_ in the first place, lol XD)

Well, this is probably just me, but I learned HTML and CSS in a day. I had no school and was _super_ bored, so I watched all the KA videos on x2 speed and raced through the challenges, XD
This is my 2nd webpage, so as you can see, imo, making something like this is not hard and very fast to learn =)

You simply forgot to define variable t.
Just add
```var t = 0.01;```to the start, and it'll work like a charm :)

The thing is, I saw how you defined all the variables outside, in the 'variables' section, but that won't work, because the map is inside a named function, so the global variables don't have a scope inside 'em.
