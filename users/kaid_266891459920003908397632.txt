Bruh. To quote DR, "what's interesting is how you find these" xD
It's a running joke in that repo you mentioned, where ski's PII gets leaked
You think idk his _alts,_ ik his _name,_ mate, _lol_

-

He is cool as in _cool,_ too
Imagine being so cool you're going to an _SI_ camp instead of _Romania_ lol

...No doubt ik him better than you, and I just think he's cooler _for_ it
He's pretty down-to-earth and a good person imho, and he's more a human than some obscure know-it-all on KA
So when he does all these cool stuff with his life, I can safely say that knowing him really will be flex-worthy :D

Also, I named his alt, if you hadn't realised >:(

"unaware" _lol_

Oki, that's mildly comprehensible now, so I think currently we're all on the same page xD

Hey! He's cool, and a friend of mine >:(

I'm just being annoying, _chill,_ pineapple, lol :D
No hard feelings, I hope? d:

_HmmMmMm_... _WhO tHo?_
...
Bueno. _?Qu? sabes_ sobre espa?ol?
Uhhh... This is what I can think of that you might know, considering what you've said regarding your incompetent instructor, o.O
`1) Conjugate _beber_ rn, all 6 forms (and tell me what _beber_ means in the first place).`
`2) Translate the following to Spanish: "Hi! My name is -----, and I am 16 years old. I go to ----- HS, and I'm in 11th grade. Right now, I'm _not_ in -----rd period, Spanish class, but my friend [female] is very annoying and I need her help."`
`3) Explain to me the difference between _ser_ and _estar_, and give the conjugation of both.`
These are all really simple, I promise I'm not flexing or smthn; you should've learnt how to do all this in Spanish I and I wanna see where you are =)

She just didn't respond ;-;

-.-

Rip.
(Oki :p)

Rip.

That wasn't a flex; you'd randomly (and incorrectly...) called me a noob (_"haha noob. he has more than 1 alt."_), so I was just trying to clarify. If I hadn't named your alt, you'd presumably still be operating under the premise I was talkin' about his nonexistent single alt, whilst, in reality, I was talking about yours, lol.
You still said it, which makes it a flex :p

What _are_ you thinking?

I love how you're flexing on knowing him tho lol
@monocle, if you decide to say hi... You're mr popularity; just knowin' you is flex-worthy xD

Perma-milkshaked; they're telling him to submit an appeal :(

Well, then, you're free to hold your own perspective, ofc... Even if it is tremendously questionable, lol

Oh, dear
Um
First off, _s?_ vs _si_. _S?_ (con acento) means yes. I typed _si_, sin acento (without an accent). _Si_ means _if_, not _yes_.
The actual translation is:
_Yes, it was very fun. Good luck with your exam... If it's like mine, you're gonna need it. (And if you can't understand this note, you need help. Fast.)_

I wonder if I can just p1ss 'em off enough to let me in, but do it in a _not_-p1ss-off-y way? I _want_ that course. A _lot_. And _asap._

What does TLC stand for?
And, I repeat, how did you call me better than 21262?!
~ DATE: 5/11/2023, 9:56:25 PM ~
Not bad.

Code cleanliness is awful. Better commenting, proper indentation, all of that is absolutely necessary. I'm not going to judge code I can barely read.
 
Efficiency? Far too many lines. Braid detailing? You can shave off hundreds of lines by looping. In the `HA` function, you seriously wrote out every `line`? You only have one monkey, why is it in a `function`? As you're making the background look like `stroke`s, you can make an offset `function` that'll automatically call the thing multiple times and `translate` + `scale` it randomly or smthn.

Looks? Colour scheme works well, that face is fantastic, very, very nice. The right side of the dress is a bit too lopsided. Dunno what's up with the monkey. The braid is too thick, although that hair is actually _very_ well done overall, :D. Why is the word "you're" split into two colours by the apostrophe? That doesn't make sense.

Complexity? Good use of complex shapes, ig. No masking or stuff that's particularly impressive or anything, tho.

Creativity? It's not even an oc. The styling is quite similar to bex, and you yourself in the comments spoke of taking after him... =P

I think that might be all the criteria: cleanliness, efficiency, final product presentation [looks], complexity, and creativity ;p

Alr, summer's your chance. Make a graphic that impresses me, and send me the link, ;). I'll be as harsh as I always am judging, which appears to be much more than what people would think, haha (hmm, ski can tell you about me roasting graphics, _lol_), so be really wary of what you present, if you wish to do so, lol. Good luck! :D

I just started work on a new graphic 15 minutes ago b'cuz I'm kinda burnt out irl, _lol_

'Tis a 'lil too simple for my liking, but ig there's some meaning to it :p
It's been so long since I released idrk how many people even remember me, lol

(Ykw?
Maybe I should host an "impress S. M. V. with graphix" contest and release the webpage right before I leave and see who does what o.O
That might actually be pretty dang epic
And efficiency will count a lot
Nothing moronic like drawing out tens of lines

If you thought broke as in _broke_, not really; it's still there, but I did break it 'nough to get access to a bunch of random files I wasn't supposed to (i.e. only devs and admin can), by trying smthn, and it actually worked :o
I even got the SSH files separately [HTML and JS and CSS... But they're not connected so I can't _really_ access the terminal, but I can _see_ it, now, after downloading the file somehow (it said 'access denied' but somehow downloaded... O.o)]

~ DATE: 5/10/2023, 9:25:54 AM ~
I'm good, you? 
Ah, APs, I see, haha... Best of luck! =)

Confidence should be seen naturally. You don't need to brag about how amazing you are, lol, that does the opposite; it's as though you're so insecure you feel the need to outwardly display every achievement without caring about those of others. Like, "Oh, hey, you did this? Well, guess what; I did something even more amazing!"
I personally like a person with a bit of an ego, they're entertaining and usually fun people. But a _superiority_ complex is smthn entirely different. Those people are occasionally... Rotten bananas, lol, c:

A 'lil is gud enough to make sure you don't die, gud ski boi! c:

Optimistic is smthn I've never been called, lol.

Uh
Eat ice cream
Go for a jog
That'll solve everything :D

ski, you have to relax. I wish I had better things to say, but... I don't. Best of luck with _everything_. Just remember, it'll all dissipate soon, how long can this stuff _possibly_ last? A few weeks, a month or two... It'll be fine, you'll be fine, mate. Hang in there :)
Also, def don't pull an all-nighter, you can't be half ded in the middle of your AP exam... xP

And I'm sorry :(

You should know this already, but I'm saying it anyways:
You're a good person
You're loved, even if you don't know it
You'll do great on everything
You'll have an amazing life
You'll accomplish all your goals
You'll not pass out in the middle of an exam b'cuz you were too tired from pulling an all-nighter
You'll go have some ice-cream b'cuz you need to chill
You'll find a girlfriend soon 'nough
Your dreams will come true
You will be someone people look up to
Heck, you already are
You're _you_
And _you_ are amazing

I could easily outrun you in the first 100 metres, so they won't bother going for me when you and your turtle-esque 15-sec pace are just waitin' to be caught, xD
But idk, I might be a good human and magically save you somehow, b'cuz you're not gettin' eaten by monsters before me, unicorn :D

No
They be nice
Nice 'lil monsters
<3

Uh...
_You?
Everything?_
'Tis harsh, my guy xD
And the quote from _Motto_ (which I was just listening to, believe it or not! :o) was, um... Yk, you're quite the master of tact, no? xDD
You're so invested in this community I honestly cannot believe it, o.o
...It's just another stupid program on this website; a program that does not matter at all in the grand scheme of things (then again, what _does?_). While your conviction is certainly admirable, I do not think it requires quite the level of action you took.
Tho, tbh, idrk what exactly is gettin' censored, there are no bad words, it's just generally harsh v(0-0)v
Maybe I'll go join that thread for no reason, and hope for the best and that I don't get milkshaked C:

I did that, too, but didn't find much, tbh
I just copied the image and it said `alt="IMG_20230225_112756"`

What even _does_ your imagination think of me for me to be _better_ than it? =P

Ah, coolio :)
It certainly does exist; with its lack, it would be a paradox.

:oo

Then it'll ice up, even worse :p

Eh, ig you won't check GH for a bit...

Yup.

From me? I'll shut up, dw :)
Oh.
"yet"?
You are. First do smthn that'll get you known, then start charging. Start a web-dev business or smthn, xD
Yet they're all ultimately lies.

:o

Only if it's coloured; you can't make a mosaic out of just broken metal pieces of the same reflectivity and shade and weight... That's not art, lol, and we've got nothin' but that mirror.
Your feeling is right, xD

Ah, lol.

The best friend's sis? Lol, good luck, :D! Oof, sorry, mate. You have a non-profit? Or is it for volunteer hours? Do you work/have a job?

:p
You are an emo unicorn boi, tho >:ppp
In the world we live in, it's more often considered insane, 'cuz while others know I speak the truth, they're too afraid to accept, too afraid to step out of their 'lil bubble made of their own lies to themselves.

When?
If it's regarding my, ah, _advice_ for you, I'm _not_ sane, _you're_ just _in_-sane :P

=o

Welp, you can try to draw on that foggy mirror, but in a 'lil bit of time, those drawings will fog up again. We can't define ourselves 'cuz we're always changing... For good or for worse. We go through pain; some, love, but we're really nothing but a foggy mirror, and we never will be. Ig our only _real_ goal should be not to shatter.

I can't do it tho, yk
I just can't

Nah, yeah, that phrasing was totally fine, lol. Very ski-ish attitude d:
You are big! Tall, at least, >:(. You're older than me. You're... _Gahhh_, two years from being grown-up... o.o

Your imagination came up with the most depressing, amazing raps ever, lol, so maybe it is cruel sometimes :p 
But then again, sometimes you're super goofy and fun and gooey, too :pp
Which one _are_ you, irl, or more frequently? The goofy ski or the depressed ski? <3

That's honestly a higher position than I would place myself :o

Who cares about surface tangents, smh >:(
The Earth's surface curves and everything on it follows that curve (we're not floating on the sUrfAcE tAngEnt line), and _so does the ground_, the ground isn't floating up despite the curve, the ground curves along _with_ the curve, so ground = curve = Earth's surface = distance from curve = how high up I am

Ha! I win 'em alllll >=D

It might be better to share, but that doesn't mean ik you enough to tell you who the heck to share it with...

The distance

~ DATE: 5/3/2023, 5:54:25 PM ~

Who cares 'bout tangent planes and surface tangents when we've got the genuine curve of the Earth we're standing on; by just measuring the distance between me on the tree and you on the ground and the point at which our... _Functions_(?) intersect the curvature of the line, my distance would be farther, so I'd be higher

=P

Aww :(
~ DATE: 5/3/2023, 11:38:08 AM ~
cccccc:

Under the same premise, my scrambling atop a tree doesn't make me taller, and you flying a plane doesn't make you taller, which is why, previously, I specified that I'd be _higher_, (i.e. _farther_) not _taller_ :ppp
:DDDDD

If I had a cat, I'd name it _Ninja_ in remembrance of your old kitty and you (b'cuz you exploded, remember? :O), lol

@WKoA -
Ah. Yours has 6 high-performance cores supporting hyper-threading, so that's 12 threads. The other 8 are power-efficient cores, each accounting for one thread. 6 + 8 = 14 cores, 12 + 8 = 20 threads, C:

@ski -
Responded there, lol
For stalkers, `compute core` = `CPU core + GPU core`, xD
He has 2 `CPU cores` and 3 `GPU cores` = `5 compute cores`, and the `CPU core` is (_obviously_) a double-core, so it has 2 threads xDD
~ DATE: 5/1/2023, 1:24:43 PM ~
Hi
Sorry
Per core, there are [usually] only two threads. You, uh, _can't_ have more cores than threads, xD, unless some cores are disabled, which I _highly_ doubt, 'specially on an enterprise-enrolled Chromebook. A dual-core CPU runs two threads per core, so there are 4 threads total (...Not 5, either, Sprout :p). Only two threads (one per core) can run simultaneously, unless it is hyper-threading, in which case two can run simultaneously [so it has 4 threads per core; 2 x 4 = 2 cores, 8 threads]. However, hyper-threading is poor for performance and inefficient. This is b'cuz each thread has to cope with the execution units left unused by the other one, so neither thread runs at maximum speed. Also, hyper-threading can lead to MDS vulnerabilities. So, moral, hyper-threading kinda sucks.
(...Wait, why hyper-threading sucks wasn't why I started this comment, was it? o.O)
(Anyways, sorry, lol...

_Think?_ Mate, you didn't exactly prove me wrong, eh? We did lose, and better leadership would've made us win. Everyone you chose ultimately went inactive. None of mine did. But... Idrc particularly much about winning a random competition on a random learning website, tho, lol... I did judge you, ig, but not b'cuz I cared about losing, it was b'cuz you were _so_ cocky and did not hold up to it, and it was a 'lil painful and quite annoying to see. 
But keep up with that cockiness, 'cuz it's usually hilarious :DD
And very, very ski-ish :DDD

Never read it, but that definitely sounds just like you, mr oblivious :D

It is most certainly a good phrase =)
Not really. You were just being annoying then, so I decided to pretend as tho I cared about the state of the team. I really don't, and I hold no hard feelings towards you, although I'm not gonna change my position in that you could most certainly do better :p
Aww... Tell me on GH once you can (if you feel comfortable doing so, ofc) :D

_Woohooooo_, lol... Give him my thanks for his motivation xD
Ouch. That sounds worse than it was, tho. I got a faulty lane in the 100 M and there was a ditch thing at the start so when he fired the gun, I got a horrid start, then there was another issue in the middle so I kinda tripped and my ankle twisted [got the worst time I _ever_ have -.-], but at that time, it didn't hurt bad enough to prevent me from anchoring the 4 x 400 relay, so if it was dislocated, idk if I could've done that xP

Def do! :D
You got your phone back?

On the bright side, it's always moving forward, so maybe you won't have to wait too long :p

Alright. The rhyme scheme is good, but some lines are too long (ig that's 'cuz it's heartfelt, but yea) marring the rhythm, especially in the one you deleted (crap, probs should've saved the one you made for me earlier, huh, lol, but good on you for doing that 'cuz stalkers :p). Also, def limit the number of rhyming words in a row to 2 [ex: not smthn like 68-70, "sowin'", "goin'", "own"].
Ohhhh, I'd totally dare you to do that but I'm a bad influence like that, xD
Nah, I'll help, just dunno how useful I'll be, sorry xP

Ah, sorry. But even in that case, I'm _really_ not the best person to ask regarding that, considering a) I'm not into rap, b) not Christian, and c) I like _rock_, an entirely different style, mainly for the electric guitar, not the lyrics, xD.

Oki... =)

You didn't want that. Under _any_ logical reasoning, even looking at the T&T you've chosen to comment under [after 3 months], you would have had absolutely no reason to think I would tell you your poem was terrible, much less _want_ that. I actually think you may have been trying to gauge my reaction regarding the poem meant for me.

I can't (more like _shouldn't_) tell you why I'm reacting the way I am, but I suppose it is mawkish, in a way.

I didn't diss on her either. Idk, you'll see when you see, ig. I didn't really diss on anyone, not really.

It was a fistfight, so I hope you haven't gotten into one, o.O...

Not entirely meant towards you (I'm 100% sure you don't really need my help, xD), but you, too, stop, please, _lol_

Kinda sad tho, xP
If people listen to me at first, they won't be pathetically screwed by the time they need me again, lol. You're not part of the people I'm talking about, but take, for example, this kid. Literally got into a full-blown fight. Warned 'em. Came runnin' back to me a while later. Fixed it, but yeah, dang, people aren't just blind, they're downright _deaf_ at times. Anyways, disregard this rant, lol.

Oh, boi. You're gonna make me feel guilty when you check GH, :(. Sorry, ski; do what you think is best. Perhaps I'm just too pessimistic.

If they don't listen to me, I'll stop telling them and they can go screw themselves 'til they come running back to me, after which I will say, "I told you so," and proceed to help them 'cuz that's what they take me for, xD...

For one, there should be a hyphen in "near-immaculate" >;)

You also misspelt the word "hesitate" as "hestitate".

_"But is it that I detect some small, nigh well insignificant accentuation to your exalted and pleasing epistle, which gives me great pause?"_

While this sentence is grammatically correct, it would be better rendered [and less painful to read] if a comma was placed after the word "insignificant" and the comma following "epistle" was removed.

You _can_ use "that", but it's not necessary, nor is the lack of it grammatically incorrect. In that context, "that" is already implied; therefore, it is unnecessary. A comma there incorrectly separates the statement into phrases that do not carry the meaning it is supposed to convey.

Holy crap.
:O)

_"My utmost apologies you must be on the receiving end of this, Captain."_

You are incorrect in that "you" is not the main subject of the sentence; _"Captain"_ is. The comma preceding that was the direct-address comma. With its use, the first presence of the subject no longer needs a comma or the word "that" to be grammatically correct, :). This is a common mistake, however, and I do not blame you for making it.

@ski -
Believe me when I say you don't want in on the grammar debate, mr pro clam, xD

Neither a comma nor the word "that" is required in the context of that phrase. A comma would entirely change the connotation while the word "that" would be redundant, as it is already implied.

As to your previous comment, you get an Earl Grey and some toast with marmalade. Perhaps some fruit salad as well. Light and healthy :p

My utmost apologies you must be on the receiving end of this, Captain. However, ski has said, "...if there's someone who might match your grammar critique, it might be him [Captain Argon]..."

Unfortunately, as much as ski likes to one-up people in coding, I enjoy doing so in the areas of grammar and hardware, so I will be pedantic as such beginning with this:

_"If I complemented anyone..."_

The word "complement" is something that completes something in some way. 
You mean to say "compliment", which is, of course, an admiring remark.

@mr I desperately need a nickname aka mr formality aka the bug -
You shouldn't use multiple semicolons in one sentence, but that is technically grammatically correct.

Idrc if it's an actual thing
It still sounds hilarious
(Or maybe I have the humour sense of a 2-yo
Or both :D)

@Ski -
A rebuttal is usually followed by elaboration; if not, it is merely a statement. Yours is not just a statement, it is an _incorrect_ statement, at that :D

ThE cOncrEtE iS cLeAn ThO

Much truth :DD

Why
You need all three lol

Ah, yeah, you're on another level >:O
You owe me a ski rap recording >:))))

So then there are still two skis, but one deems the title of a manager :d

@HS -
A semicolon is used to join two independent relevant phrases; as both address a similar topic, conjoining them in such a way is, in fact, not grammatically incorrect.

How even did you come up with that name? xDD, Wogglebug. Even if I were to nickname you, dunno if I could top that, _lol_.

@Ski -
*smirks*
At least I _have_ a basis for reality...
Some people just like living in 'lil bubbles comprised of illusions...
Illusions such as _people won't mess with me if I have a bio that says "don't mess with me"_ :O

Hmm, that phrase has a questionable connotation :p

I said "seldom", so they do come true at times :D
Also you get too many notifs from me for them to be of any value or for you to have to wish to get one lol

Enjoy the questioning, but the accuracy is 100000% accurate, endorsed by me, :D!

Oh, that's much easier. Now all I need is sand, vinegar, and stale urine :d

@HS -
The only semicolon in that statement was, "However, if you are going to pick at one's grammar, please make sure yours is correct; as an example, I have pointed out some fallacies here..."
Am I mistaken; did I miss something...?
Hehe, nope, I like my semicolons, :D.

[Please ignore the grammar in my messages that are clearly not paying attention to grammar, :).]

@Ski -
"...your basis for reality...", _my_ basis for reality, smh xD

How does the phrase "if you say so" make sense there, though?

Wishes seldom come true...

Eh, detesting something doesn't make it any less accurate, though, eh? >=D

You only anticipated extinguishing a fire. Here's the problem: I'm not fire. 
I'm the whole, dang ocean. 
You don't extinguish me, I extinguish you >;)

I certainly can and I clearly have, oyster ;D

When do you see a singular ski? Uh, when you hide the other...? If you crash really badly and one ski falls off?

xDD
Thank you!
Thank you again! :DD

Ah. It is a Perlin noise SVG filter:
```
        <svg width="0" height="0" style="display: none;">
            <filter id="noise">
                <feTurbulence type="turbulence" baseFrequency="0.01" numOctaves="2"/>
                <feDisplacementMap in2="turbulence" in="SourceGraphic" scale="10" xChannelSelector="B" yChannelSelector="R"/>
            </filter>
        </svg>
```

It'll make the thing it's applied on have a sort of turbulence... A noisy, shaky, look. The `baseFrequencey` and `numOctaves` show how noisy the noise is. The displacement map takes the `in2`, the `turbulence` specified in `feTurbulence`, and applies it to the `SourceGraphic` in `in`. The numbers in `scale` show how much to apply it.

Nope lol
In retrospect, tho, after I released it, I realised it did look kinda like that xD

Why thank you, Arfy! >=DDD

@Promise -
You may be able to beat the peasants, but I suppose I am a queen. Believe me when I say none of you can beat me in grammar. That semicolon was a typo, much like Ski's clam. It should have said, "Every, single, comment, not just to me." 

However, if you are going to pick at one's grammar, please make sure yours is correct; as an example, I have pointed out some fallacies here:

_I know you weren't trying to use "proper grammar" (you have a couple [OF] verb-less sentence fragments and other grammatical errors besides [NO PREDICATE]), but if you use a semicolon, for goodness's sake, please use it correctly._

I now have no qualms about my grammatical pedantry towards you- You have attempted to denigrate mine. It was a futile attempt, but an attempt nonetheless.

It sounded like a wannabe savage ninja that's actually a soft and fluffy pink rainbow unicorn inside, _awwww_ >=D
[I will never, ever let you live that down, mate :D]

Evidently, I do.

You wished me a "warm pillow" (like a big fat meanie >:O), but I wished you "nothing but the best", so is it the circle of life?
And two wrongs don't make a right =P

That may have been slightly more impactful had you not misspelt the word "proclaim"

Aw =(
But that bio literally challenged everyone to tease you

You're the best lol
_ski logix ftw!_
I can't believe you actually bothered writing a paragraph explaining that, though, tbh xD

I wonder what _that's_ supposed to mean...

Ikr?! It's _fantastic!_ :DDDD

_Hahahahaaaaaaaaaa_
I will send her a screenshot of this once I can

@Pineapple -
What I saw was quite pretty...
Greenery, trees, and then 5-8 peacocks
There was a Bengal tiger just chillin' on a tree, too
The peacocks can get annoying, though; one just strutted up the house of my uncle and started pecking the window for no reason, lol

#skiLogix ?

@unicornz -
I mean, who _else_ would draw a unicorn on your portrait? 
I enjoyed that far too much, ngl xDD

I can recall my grandmum actually frying smthn on the concrete just to make a point
[We didn't eat it, for the record.
That's unhygienic lol]

_pair of skis'_ is a mouthful. Ya couldn't have picked anything easier? >=O
I tend to make people do that c:
It was _such_ a teasable bio, you've reallyyyy gotta admit

Fine, if you won't send us that rap, I dare you to write with _proper_ grammar tomorrow. Every, single, comment; not just to me. Proper grammar. From ski. Now _that_ would be a sight to behold o.o

@DR -
He'll be back sometime in the next 7 days
_"...you won't hear back from me for a while [probs 'till next week] so this is adios an' au revoir for now. see ya then..."_
(- ski, 5 days ago)

He'd also told me this, and I told Astro, but I started making one anyways, even though it'll not be smOrT, xP, but ig it's a very temporary start...?
_"i assume primavera is okay considerin' Astro hasn't emailed me. [get a sample judgin' program set up with the criteria 'bove for now. i'll finish this one later.] if y'all need help, have Astro shoot an email, but he hasn't yet so i assumed everythin' is fine."_

So
Uh
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/5215849561767936
The scores on the program above are weighed as his were in the psuedo-code of his judging program WIP :p
I didn't put more than 30 mins into it 'cuz I thought Astro had it covered, so it's not good or efficient
But perhaps it's better than nothing
Idk
And you're all smart so maybe you could, uh, smarten that program up...? xD

Oki, thanks :)

"Enough" is a word that means smthn different for everyone :p
Comments threads like these usually end up hidden, lol
I believe that a higher, more supreme being exists; however, I do not believe it is truly sentient and can read human minds or listen to our prayers or such. I think the concept of God, to humanity, is the result of our innermost wishes and desires welded into a figment of our imagination. I think God to us is a method of coping; I think we run merely on the _belief_ of something higher that cares about us, and that's perfectly fine :)
My family does have a religion and believe in God, but (internally) I don't entirely follow their beliefs.

(Ig now anybody stalking my comments will now hate me.

Yes, yes, it is :)

What is the probability of smthn like that vs getting killed in a car crash or the like? You can't live your entire life waiting for the future and "what is going to happen" 'cuz while you can certainly be optimistic, you've also gotta be realistic. 
Don't live with your head in the clouds and forget about your feet on the ground. In the end, which is keeping you stable?

Oki then xD
Yep. Lol, remember that grammar debate with... _Reggie_ (xD)?

I think I can guess where you were going xD

But... But... But... _TAxEs!_ :ooo
Jk, hahaaaaa, I literally cannot wait 'til I'm 18 and can legally leave, lol. Might leave earlier, actually, if I can graduate early... o.O. But I'm still in middle school, so perhaps I'm overplanning just a _'lil_, lol.
I wanna be an adult to be entirely self-sufficient without any legal ties to anybody. I want to achieve success independently, make my own name, make _money_ (but not be a corrupt fool), and see the world :D

Eh. Live life so if you die right now, you'd be happy with what you've done in that time. Ig that means smthn different for everyone, so live for yourself and screw absolutely everyone who says otherwise. Unless, ofc, you wanna murder someone and someone tells you not to or smthn; in that case, please do not screw them; go get therapy ;p
(I pull everything out of thin air and attempt to sound like I have half a brain. So no judgement here =D)

---

Yes, _pAnIk_ is my lifestyle c:
Most certainly not; that would contradict with the "weary", right? xD
I am jealous of your amazing extroversion, _how?!_ =O
Haha, yep :)
For me, petty rivalries = random debates, lol >:)
Remember our debate on ski's comment?
That was fun, ngl.
And we're friends :d
That's friendship in a nutshell, lol :p
~ DATE: 4/6/2023, 7:56:14 PM ~
Or... Chill and eat ice cream, ya know? You've got the rest of your life to panic and do eventful things, lol. Enjoy life as it is 'cuz it really isn't gonna be that way very long, :d. Like, in 3 years, you'll be an _adult,_ :O!

I suppose a friend's friend is always a friend, but also try to find other people sharing similar interests as you. 
As to the introvert thing... o.o, I do not talk _remotely_ as often irl as I do on KA (wow, my just barging into a convo like this? Never, _ever_ gonna happen, hahaha. [Well, not unless ADHD gets the better of me, that is...]), and my brain goes _pAnIk_ if some person says something as normal as a "hi", lol (take for example my teacher, every single morning. Why. _Why_ do I get so flustered regarding a simple "mornin', S. M. V.!"?! _Smh,_ lol). 
_Anyways,_ relating back to my original point, I'd say find a common interest first. If someone randomly asked me what book I was reading, I'd be much more likely to respond in a remotely human way (as opposed to looking up like a weary demon and sprinting away [okay, this might _possibly_ be _slightly_ exaggerated. I might only run away, not necessarily sprint ;p]) than if someone said "hi" xD
On a final note, while getting others to talk is a fantastic way to work on social skills, I do not think it's the best way to form a friendship. Friendships operate on trust and mutual experiences, not necessarily one person speaking all the time, so make sure to throw in your own two cents when necessary and actively listen (instead of zoning out like I do =P).

...
Alr, adi?s, au revoir, et adieu; there ends socialisation 101 :d

Ig I'm stressed about being alone again, yk? I'm not good enough, nothing I do makes anyone happy, everything can be _more_, yet I can't do it, and the thing I'm insanely good at, I can literally not do anymore b'cuz I don't have the resources, and those in power absolutely refuse to give me them. I've been told mean things by said people and sometimes I just wanna give up. My friends (both irl and online) won't be there forever and most are older than me so they'll leave for college soon enough and we'll lose contact which will be really, really sad. I suppose I'm scared of being alone again and again and again. I do things to take my mind off of stuff like this, but I don't have fifteen projects stacked up and life has let up a 'lil so my mind just keeps wandering back here: _what'll I do when everyone's gone?_

Silence is wonderful
Talking is overrated =P

That's good. Ish. Nothing lasts forever, lol... Not even pain ;)

You can delete the link now; I'll respond on GH at some point.

See, _this_ is what you should do instead of going MIA with a cliffhanger, lol. See ya, dear ninja <3

I have no idea who that is.

- Even if it is, all that's broken will mend. So will you.
- Is it tho?
- I wish the word "worse" could be graphed as `ax? + bx + c`, 'cuz at least then it'll hit a vertex but _nope_... It's like `lim f(x) = ?` as `x => whatever`, lol; no matter where you are and where you're going, it's always at `(worst, ?)`. Yet the measure of that `?` always manages to get even worse, but that would render "worst" false as "worst" would be the highest degree, and if it gets more, the previous "worst" would _not_ be the worst. (This has lost every false sense of coherency it never had, xD. Don't you love my analogies?)
- Life is what you make it.
- No bird learns to fly without first falling.
- Answers are questions in themselves.
- Control is an illusion. Don't live on illusions.
- Too much pressure makes things explode.
- Loneliness is my best friend. (After you... >;p)
- We all are. If you're replaceable, nothing you do will ever matter, so do what you enjoy in your time, not insignificant little tasks that, in the end, will add up to absolutely _nothing_. We all march to the same finale. Maybe march over a field of grass instead of rocky rubble, eh?

Also, why are there two scrollbars on the webpage?

Alr, so now I'm rather concerned.

My default atm is that you got more grounded, or that our chat got discovered, or that you're travelling (which seems unlikely if your father is not at home...). The others (dw, they don't know everything) are claiming you're studying or smthn, but considering you're on Spring break (according to your school's calendar), I doubt that what's happening (and that'd also just be plain freakin' mean ;-;). 
Please lmk asap what's up (and give me whatever that mysterious link is o.O)

I'm testing out `ctx` rn... But idk if I should make it with an actual webpage or keep it an animated graphic. Idk what content to add if I do make it a webpage, though, haha
I mean... You're, like, one of the best web-devs here, lol, so =P

=D

Of course :D

..._How?_ Lol, how did this come to be? xD
~ DATE: 4/2/2023, 9:29:36 AM ~
Yup, CBF especially, lol :D

I've made precisely 3 webpages, so now I feel a bit validated, lol.
Even before you were active again, I've admired your webpages. 
Actually, you, ski, CoraL, and Promise were why I even tried learning HTML =P

My goodness, it looks even more amazing now! I love it! :DDD

Lol

I subbed, btw...
But, ofc, I kinda _had_ to with this awesome-ness, hahaha

Oh, yeah, and you're the father of DR and LG? xD
~ DATE: 4/2/2023, 9:24:07 AM ~
Whoa, nice! And you even fixed the arc's positioning :D

Oh, lol
~ DATE: 4/1/2023, 10:18:59 PM ~
_Bruh,_ what the heck is this mysterious link already?
My ADHD is going insane rn >=(
Been a whole _day_ after asking when _I'll_ be online, _smh_.
_Hellooooooooo_
Give me the linkkkkkkk xP
If it has anything to do with April fools... >:(

After 8 AM your time tomorrow I'll probs be offline for a while, so just to lyk :p

How the heck do you so nonchalantly leave me on a cliffhanger like this >:(((
"this...this is smth i hope i don't regret."
...I'm gonna presume smthn not-so-great happened irl in that time, though o.O
~ DATE: 4/1/2023, 10:05:07 PM ~
:D 
_Nahhh,_ lol, no, _sOmeBoDy_ said the only person who'd join team Magus would be someone with the username _UNICORNS ARE REALLL!1!!_ and I disagreed  so I asked on my subpage if anyone would join that team... And the rest is history xD

True, lol, it looks amazing! :D
I absolutely love the landing page o.o
And the text animations :D
And the freaking awesome colour scheme =D

One thing, though, the menu place (with the _About, Team_ and all those) might look a bit better aligned to the centre with a teensy bit more padding between that and the title, specifically on the _About_ page. Perhaps an active tab might be nice to have, and a transition (maybe a simple fade opacity?) whilst changing pages. Also, perhaps a better hover effect on the projects page (plus maybe smooth out the border-radius?) =P

^ Completely feel free to disregard this if you want to, ofc; my "speciality" is not webpages, lol :p
~ DATE: 4/1/2023, 9:50:51 PM ~

Fineee xD

Okay, fine... I'm just dome xD

Thanks, lol
~ DATE: 4/1/2023, 7:35:11 PM ~
I found out and saw some people's emails but I didn't look at yours b'cuz I didn't wanna do it to you. It only works on some people, as well, but I didn't test it on you in case it did, lol. We never got a reason as to why it didn't work on everyone, smh, :(. Eh, pretty much, lol.
'Cuz I am :D

_Lol_
Fine, I don't live in either of those places =P
~ DATE: 4/1/2023, 7:13:11 PM ~
No, lol. I don't wanna invade peoples' privacy :p
Where did I even say that rn, lol...?
=P

Whatever you want it to... >:)
~ DATE: 4/1/2023, 6:52:48 PM ~
Lol, you're good :p

Maybe xD
All the disordered comments + comment issues a bit ago. I found out you could easily find out others' emails by decoding smthn. Found it out on vxs, then told WKoA who, along with TBP, put it in a script which gave the emails of so many people, and then he told KA on all our behalf :)
Also, yes, you need a new email for alts, lol, sorry.

=P

Ikr? That was epic :D
~ DATE: 4/1/2023, 6:47:11 PM ~
Nope :D
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 11:06:07 PM ~
What do you mean "transfers UART"? UART is kinda like a communication protocol but a hardware circuit =P
And cat5 is decent but that's UTP [usually, iirc] so there'll be more noise (why you needed to debounce. Did my suggestion work, btw?) so you might wanna look into STP which deals with noise better (gets rid of crosstalk).
Btw, UART baud rate isn't the best and full-duplex is better than half-duplex for performance speed (half-duplex reduces bandwidth tho 'cuz only one communication at a time [TDD. Ish]) and I think you mentioned how you wanted it faster...?

So, did electrix guy come or not?
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 10:39:14 PM ~
@Sprout -
This thread or that thread? o.O
Yes. Much namez for the s'mores c:
Sorry
Noice, noiceee. RS485 is half-duplex, right?
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 6:41:46 PM ~
Well, alright, then :)

When was the last time, then? I'd say it was... Yesterday, in that the flappy bird chap was wrong =P

Rn is good :))

You wouldn't believe the number of times dear ol' Sprout has done that and none of 'em worked ;)
Oki, wonderful build-up, now _gimme_

You can't use votes to buy anything, therefore they are worthless. Money has worth, so it counts as pay. Votes do not.
:p

Yes, yes, yes, definitely yes >:)))

Hey, that's not _that_ foreign, lol!

Uh.
If you send it in, like, the next 10 minutes I'll look right after. But then I'll be gone for a bit, so if not within the next 10 minutes, give me it at, like, 10 PM =P

I swear if you are trying to log my IP the savage ninjas will have a unicorn horn sticking out of the wrong place >=(

If you send it and I don't respond within the next 10 mins just delete it for that time, tho :p
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 5:57:38 PM ~
How 'bout a regex that finds `/s` after a certain width and replaces it with `/n` ignoring the `/n`s in the original text which will automatically go to the next line instead of using `\n` and `.map` to make new arrays?

(There'll probably be a bajillion things wrong with this but hey, just throwing random stuff out there, lol.)

@Sprout -
The door thingy?
You looked into the ESP32 more?
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 5:51:28 PM ~
For the arc, subtracting `w / 2` from x and `h / 2` from y fixes the positioning issue, so perhaps replace `    ctx.translate(x, y)
` with `ctx.translate(x - w/2, y - h/2)`...? 
Maybe use regex to find text with the qualifier `\s` (excluding `\n` to keep original line breaks) and replace that with `\n` instead of just splitting the original text, adding `/n`, and calling a new array using `map`...?
No idea 'bout the lerp lol

...You can't spice up nonexistent food xD
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 1:46:26 PM ~
Oki, I won't, then xD

They really don't.
I mean... Even if you're filled with doubt, just ask yourself if there's anyone you'd trust more than yourself to do that task, lol. If the answer is _no,_ yk you've gotta quit doubting. Elsewise, just get someone else to do the job. Better yet, learn from 'em =P
If you surround yourself with morons, then you've gotta change your surroundings, lol. Even near the darkest cave, there has to be light, 'cuz if there was never light, you'd never know you were _in_ a cave; you'd never question the absence of light 'cuz that'd have been the only thing you'd have ever known. So... All you have to do is find the light. B'cuz it _is_ there, hiding somewhere, just waiting to be found by the one who knows what to look for ;)
[Uh, not necessarily excludin' me, lol. You can enjoy your light. Yk what to search for. I don't.]

:p
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 1:26:20 PM ~
Aww.
Well.
Is there literally anything I can do to make smthn easier on you? 
:)
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 1:24:58 PM ~
Job, in that context, is defined as "a paid position of regular employment." As you are not getting paid, this is not a job.
(Why am I like this? xD)

Emo unicorn boi lol >:))

Yes, yes you are.

Yeah, it's a 'lil... Weird toward the end. Dunno if I'd recommend.

Oh, oki, lol :)

You've heard of IPL in books? o.O
What books, lol...?

Oh
Idk any names either, lol
I think 80% of the reason why I find archery cool is 'cuz of the _Hunger Games_ xD

...
Random:
Yk how you said you'd sent screenshots to your hacky friends?
Have you sent anything of my idiocy?
Idrc; I'm just curious =P
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 11:43:02 AM ~
The definition of hobby is as _"an activity done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure."_
"For pleasure" = fun.
So... =P

Yea lol

What's wrong with white? :p
Oki lol

Idk, it's just a judging program so just ignore my comments regarding design if you want lol
~ DATE: 3/31/2023, 11:32:04 AM ~

Cool ig

I've never been to an amusement park or fair or anything either lol

You are many things (including a unicorn), but "stupid" is not one of them :p

Oki lol

What show is that xD
That sounds like smthn I've said so many times irl but mine was more sarcastic, lol

~ DATE: 3/30/2023, 10:20:58 PM ~
1) B4n => Banana => Milkshake
Reverse-engineer a milkshake => Unbanana => Unb4n

How much do you give me before (if) I become a milkshake?

1) Wrapping is optional and only occurs when text width/height is specified. 

2) The line wrap was a feature request and it'd be very good to have for, say, story plot lines for games. It's also a request and ski asked me to tell him of "all bugz an' feature requestz", lol.
~ DATE: 3/30/2023, 4:25:37 PM ~

Nobody is flawless but many seem to think you are, so pointing out those of your creation is cool to 'em, lol

Sorry, I'm not adding you. Quite frankly, I do not know you well enough, and there is far too much PII in there than I am comfortable having known. Furthermore, that'd involve the coordination of a few more people and they are not quite comfortable with this either :)

At least SP was active, which is more than what can be said of you, so you shouldn't be complaining =[

Both; if there's a finite number of gears and everyone collects 'em all, it'll be too easy to get on the leaderboard. But if the updating for both will be too hard to implement, I'd say just time (like the original idea).

Also
"don't mess with me" o.O

I've just got low-kwality drawings for  'em atm (so no links), but they'll be done by the 27th, no worries :p
What's your GH username? I can send you pictures there :D

_Liam K 2.0, the snazzy, stupendous, superb sea monster (jr)_ it is!
People will flock to be on that team, ngl. 
Ooh, and I should give the monster some ePiC hAIr, too, xD

Nice find lol

Fine 'bout the Bluetooth, but factor in performance, average cost, GPIO number and all, and ESP32 wins it, no cap. It's also compatible with the Arduino IDE and almost everything is similar/same in terms of software ;p

Nvidia is best for high-end (raytracing, 4k) while AMD is good for 1440 and 1080p, Nvidia has better performance and DLSS. AMD is more user-friendly, b'cuz they actually update their stuff and make their stuff compatible with everything. Ig it depends on what you want, tho, as to which one's better :p

Other brand, ESP32? Yeah, it's probs better for you to stick with this, but in general... ESP32 > Arduino >:)))
Lol, I hadn't realised that (while PoE is better, I didn't have access to Ethernet everywhere. One of ESP32's best things is the fact it has both WiFi and Bluetooth B)), but it does have more GPIO pins =D

_Lol,_ fair enough, mate, fair enough xD
Also Nvidia is generally better :p
Less user friendly, but better, more powerful :D

Neither of that makes me smart, lol; perhaps you have low expectations (what _did_ you expect, o.O, I told you I was decent with wires...), and I wouldn't say Bradford-Hill criteria or whatever is the epitome of high IQ; 5 mins of studying, half a brain, and a smidge of luck is all you need. Atop that, I entirely screwed up the bridge demonstration in said competition. (Thank God we have another chance at the next level, tho; we got efficiency up to upwards ~1327.6. That's actually insane, ngl.)

But thanks for the pickup, ig, sorry :)

Hello!

Can I beseech you for a deadline extension until midnight on Friday? The logic people have all gone inactive (in all honesty, ski _just_ spawned back into existence there, but we all know of his _aMazInG_ reliability). We're quite close to completion, although there's no way we'll finish quite in time, so it would be super, duper amazing of you to extend it, please! :D

And ik the original answer will be "no", but perhaps with this...
...
...Would you like to have a Primavera avatar named after you? 
xD, I'm not even kidding; you can choose from a unicorn, a sea monster, a phoenix, a dragon, a gryffin, and a wolf =P
(100% trying to bribe you, lol.)

Apologies, but I wouldn't say I am behind; I suppose I just haven't kept you particularly aware of their status, so here:

And you're not getting any sneak peaks, for the record ;p

Idk if this changes anything, but here is all the game's code so far put together :p

https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/nincompoop/6110739742113792

The background is currently in `playScene`, but that's just a placeholder as there are 4 more backgrounds [15 levels; three per background].

...Sorry for spawning in, I was just stalking ski as any normal human does when bored =P
Also, hi, idk you at all, but ski's spoken of you (positive connotation, lol), nice to have you on the team =)

Bonjour, Tyler! Je m'appele Marie!

I am bored once more, lol. So, ofc, I'll just annoy you, and, ofc, just don't respond if you don't wanna :p

I need to get a life again b'cuz now my Tuesdays and Thursdays have opened a bit which sucks 'cuz I like actually having smthn to do; I'd die of boredom elsewise :pp

How's life?

On a slightly less tangential point, are there any particular backgrounds you want me to make for the CoC program? Maybe I can put this time to a bit of useless use. And portal gun or time machine? I already made a time machine, so idk if I should make both... =P

- ski.js is _running_ normal JS in HTML, but things I used in the code like `strokeWeight` aren't in 'normal JS', as you know; if you were rendering graphics using normal JS on an HTML5 canvas, it'd be `ctx.lineWidth`. I was talking about the game's code not being in normal JS, not ski.js not being in JS. That's obviously JS, lol.

- There's just a blank loading screen for, like, 45 seconds if it's `loopTimeout` by dkareh or KWC, and idk any others, so perhaps I'm mistaken. Ik there's `jshint:ignore` or `jsesnext:true` and those, but that's not what I meant, :p. If you toss in `type`, even if it's blank, in the `<script>` tag, there's never any wait or delay and it always works =p

- Is that legal?

@Jake K -
Not too familiar with them, but Ashkenazy. And have you heard their double concerto? I'm sure you have... o.o

Beethoven is amazing and _Moonlight Sonata_ is beautiful, although I wouldn't call it my favourite. _Symphony No 3_ is his best imo. Vivaldi's _4 Seasons_ is a stunning composition (my favourite is _Autumn_) and Chopin's _Fantaisie-Impromptu_ is insane, lol. I still like Rachmaninoff more overall :p

What's your favourite key?
I love G minor and F# minor.

Most KA users are American so my default goes there. Timezones match, somewhat. Most words are spelt using the American spelling.

I personally have an affinity toward Rachmaninoff; his Cello Sonata is absolutely amazing, probably my favourite piece (cellos and pianos ftw!). I also love Schumann. Actually, I love Romantic era music in general, although I wouldn't say I'm a fan of opera. Verdi is amazing, though. It's really nice to see other classical lovers :D

Oki, xD, I can't do Hindi either, lol. Ik a lot of other random languages but perhaps I should focus more on the Indian ones, huh... xP
From there, don't live there anymore.
You follow IPL?
(yes, this is my 1st question when I find someone's Indian, _lol_)

Well. There are 12 vowels and 18 letters, both of which can be used separately. And then 12 vowels ? 18 consonants to make more letters. Combo letters, ig. And then one unique letter that makes the consonants sound like i + [consonant]. There are also special letters (that I didn't count in the 247; they're called Grantha letters) that are really similar to Sanskrit, like ????, sri, and are used pretty much exclusively for writing English or Sanskrit in Tamil.
? > ka, consonant
? > aa, vowel
? + ? = ?? > ka + aa = kaa, but kaa is also just a letter
? + ? = ?? > ka + uhk = ik
? is only a half-letter, though, it can't be used elsewhere, except for one or two words like ????, meaning steel :p

That is painfully relatable xDDDD
Are you Indian? Or just learning Hindi on Duolingo, lol...?

That is not how it should look.
I know I'm using it only on the gradient and the gradient should not look like that. Check GH again for an example :)
I'm using posterize on the gradient and layering said gradient atop the menu. The gradient should still have posterize and I don't _want_ the rest to have posterize b'cuz that's stupid.

The gears are gonna be somewhat hidden anyways using a posterized gradient to make the text and buttons pop. Yellow on it would detract attention from the text in the foreground b'cuz yellow, being such a bright colour, naturally attracts the eye ;p

@Animation Guy -
B'cuz 50,000 calories per meal with 30,000 calories of snacks in between is downright insane and startlingly unhealthy. Perhaps you're mistaken in the count?

(My concern merely increases as the phrase "only 54 Oreo cookies" appears... "Only"... o.o)
54 Oreo cookies a day.
893 Oreo cookies a day.
What seems healthier? 
Your, ah, _method_ may give you more Oreo cookies but mine gives you more... You know... _Years alive_ xD

Think

...Also, yes, perhaps if they were Chips Ahoys as opposed to Oreos I would join you in eating that 893 xD

That'd be an ESTJ, then.
Rather surprised, lol. You don't seem like an ESTJ here, but ig idk you well enough on that :p
(And I'm not scary intelligent if I screwed the order that much xD)

Some people here are _super_ obvious to guess, though, lol.

Also, yay, someone else who knows smthn about cognitive functions on KA! =o
And, lol, I didn't memorise, but the method for finding cognitive functions after looking at a type is quite easy ;)
If the first letter is E, the third letter + E is the dominant (ex: ESTJ > T + E = Te). Auxiliary is the opposite extrovert/introvert for the second letter (es: ESTJ > Opposite of extrovert [thinking] is introvert. 2nd letter S. S + I = Si.). Tertiary is the opposite of auxiliary (ex: ESTJ > opposite of Si is Ne). Inferior is the opposite of dominant (ex: ESTJ > opposite of Te is Fi). See, easy! :D

Hmm.
Cognitive functions.
You have Fi, looks like.
That'd mean Te.
I don't think you have Ni, so Ne, which would be Si.
I cannot, however, decide the order of these functions...
Dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, inferior...
Looks like Ne dom. If it's Ne dom, it's aux Fi, tertiary Te, then Si inferior.
If you're anything irl like you are on here, you are an ENFP. Perhaps an INTP irl, but here, you appear to be an ENFP, or against my better judgement (confused 'bout high Fe, too; trickster function?), an ENFJ :)

Yep! From my original code [on a GitHub repo atm, lol]:
```
    <!-- HOLY CRAP IT WORKS [the second]: loading -->
    <!-- <script type="module">
        let load = document.getElementById ("load");
        let menu_tab = document.getElementsByClassName("menu_tab");
        
        const delay = (millis) => {
            return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, millis));
        }
        
        const hide = async() => {
            await delay(1500);
            load.style.opacity = 0;
            await delay(2000);
            load.style.display = "none";
        }
        
        hide ();
    </script> -->
```

That you are :D
(Although I've only seen one of 'em, maybe I'll dig through your projects later, lol.)
Why thank you! You actually have no idea how much that means lol :DDD
And yes, they're so easy. Even easier than `begin`/`endShape`, tbh, lol.

Ah, yeah. Improved my CSS, though; everything for the nav-bar (except showing active) is done using CSS! >:D
Yeah, I'll probs just leave 'em, lol.

Fix the sticky menu? Sorry xP

In a final sense, what information is not "useless"? What will truly help us? What will being able to "apply" it ever do?

Also, you have bragging rights for being my friend >;P
And for being the best savage ninja ever :D
...You're a fantastic person, yk, and you're the only one of you to ever exist, so you already have bragging rights for that, and you always, always, will ;)

2) That's 'cuz it's a `box-shadow`, lol. Line 304. Fixed now, is it better? :D
3) True, lol. Too lazy to change it rn tho, xD, but I'll definitely keep it in mind for next time :)
4) It seems to fit with the styling a 'lil better with both but maybe I'll change the 2nd one to posts =)

Ah! I doubt you'll find one like that ;)
Severely modified used `feCovolveMatrix` + `feDisplacementMap` and a kernel matrix; hardly recognisable at this point, I'd say :D

That's good to know, but sucks that it only works after you reload, smh xD

That looks more unprofessional tbh; the default fonts' letters are more perfectly aligned and shaped and it's unnecessary to make them customised if the quality, speed, and effort/efficiency levels are compromised upon doing so :P

I want the new one to be voted to the top, lol. I'll go fix that xP
Yeah, `type="module"` enables es6, but using it on the page script ensures nothing works at all, for some reason o.O

_Yes._ Chocolate is fantabulous and has surpassed the mortal sensations of temperature acuity  :o. Therefore, you _must_ have hot cocoa. 'Tis necessary :ooo
Yw! You're _you, ofc_ you will! :D
Ah, oki. (You're _sure_ you're name's not Tyler, Wyatt, or Warren? xD)

Welp.
You did.
And it was funny. 
:p

Yay c:
(For once I'm more than annoying, =O)

:D
You can always try...
Even if it's half as good, tho, it'll still be tremendously entertaining, _lol_
(think of this as relaxing after you finish whatever you need to do for the CoC program lol :p)

This should be fine, ig. On line 126, though, it's annoying me a bit, can you change `this.h - 1.5` to `this.h - 2.5`? I forgot it has to be 1/2 the radius, not strokeWeight xP

Also, take away the stroke for the arrow.

Idk who to talk to.
You're awesome <3)
Life? Insane. Absolutely insane. Stressed to the max, but I can't show it. Crazy number of stuff going on. Suddenly feel super alone; really miss some people I used to know. But I've always been an independent person, so gotta grind my way out. Gonna have to travel again for three months, gonna have guests, schoolwork is utterly psychotic, and I am taking the optional credit exam and college-level sciences for a future chance at a scholarship via a huge national, heck, _international_ competition. Yet I feel like a moron; ik I can do better, but also, life is meant to be lived and getting a PhD like my 16 yo cousin is not what I plan to do. Look around irl and I still feel _somewhat_ smart; take a look on KA, and there's my fellow friend taking 5 college classes at 15-16. Oh, and music concerts in between all that. I suppose CoC, too, but that's not particularly the highest priority. Finished my part for round 2 ages ago, but my collab partner is not done with his part. 
Essentially, gonna break, generally dead, but... It's not the worst it could be, I suppose :)

1. Coloured dots? That sounds a 'lil lame, ngl lol.
How about a message written in low-opacity letters on the wall as "invisible" ink for the 2nd easy challenge? The first might just be unlocking the door with a key or smthn lol. One of them could be there's a piece of paper laying around and when the robber gets close, a message opens up with 4 riddles on it: 

"Answer these, and the number each term holds
will show you the pin as your escape unfolds.

What can run but can't walk? 
[river > 5]
What has a neck but no head? 
[shirt > 5]
What goes up but never comes down? 
[age > 3]
What flies without wings?
[time > 4]

[pin: 5534]"

Or smthn like that :D

Another level could just be like the classic platformer, escaping the guards' shooting. Another could be an easy anagram: teh rnasew si en-ohuotasnd, horufnu-dder, xi-sytereht. 
(The answer is 1463 :p)

Another could be the Fibonacci pattern: 
The first 4 positive numbers from this formula commonly found in nature: 
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
...I think that's the right formula, lol... o.o

Idk.
Maybe?
Idk how hard all of this will be to implement, so maybe not...

2. Idrk, maybe vertexes instead of lines and then mask the block shapes inside that? As to positioning, I presume you can't change the `x, y` part of the image? Not a clue, lol.

3. It's underground? Oki then. The bricks are now light blue. They'll go well with the dark blue brick background for the parallax feel :P

1. Coloured dots? That sounds a 'lil lame, ngl lol.
How about a message written in low-opacity letters on the wall as "invisible" ink for the 2nd easy challenge? The first might just be unlocking the door with a key or smthn lol. One of them could be there's a piece of paper laying around and when the robber gets close, a message opens up with 4 riddles on it: 

"Answer these, and the number each term holds
will show you the pin as your escape unfolds.

What can run but can't walk? 
[river > 5]
What has a neck but no head? 
[shirt > 5]
What goes up but never comes down? 
[age > 3]
What flies without wings?
[time > 4]

[pin: 5534]"

Or smthn like that :D

Another level could just be like the classic platformer, escaping the guards' shooting. Another could be an easy anagram: teh rnasew si en-ohuotasnd, horufnu-dder, xi-sytereht. 
(The answer is 1463 :p)

Another could be the Fibonacci pattern: 
The first 4 positive numbers from this formula commonly found in nature: 
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
...I think that's the right formula, lol... o.o

Idk.
Maybe?
Idk how hard all of this will be to implement, so maybe not...

2. Idrk, maybe vertexes instead of lines and then mask the block shapes inside that? As to positioning, I presume you can't change the `x, y` part of the image? Not a clue, lol.

3. It's underground? Oki then. The bricks are now light blue. They'll go well with the dark blue brick background for the parallax feel :P

Could you make something like `textLeading` in ski.js? =P
Not now, maybe later, but that'd be nice to have. 
Atm, it's a fair bit too small; the... Smush-iness... Looked a 'lil odd on both _brave_ and the current _Antihero_. Or is there already a way my dumb butt doesn't know of...? Can we use `line-height` from CSS somehow?

Also, did you do a bit of a clean-up with your projects? :p

When the dude stands next to them, they get bigger and then you enter the key code you find using clues in the room and type/punch in the combination and they open? Or maybe nothing at all that fancy and they just take a key nearby and plug it in and the jail door opens :p
Sure!
(I'll edit this back again, but could you send me a reference on GH b'cuz idrk what you mean by block graphics; like any particular textures [like the bricks I made earlier?] or...?)
Oki =)
Yeah, I'll add a transition ofc and maybe a sine rectangle background (like the thing on the team ninjaz logo part of that project [and I'll edit this thing out too lol])? I'd steal your particles but that's also...  Stealing... Your particles... Lol. 
I've also gotta fix the menu button's position, now that looks awful, lol.

Great =D

So ya see how all the way at the bottom, I made this function?
It ofc works like a classic for loop in PJS for repeated circles or whatever. But now I want the circles to append to different pages. Obviously, the child will just move if you call it again in a different div, but I want it to appear on both pages, without cloning to maintain the versatility =P
And I can't and Google is useless b'cuz anything similar involves cloning which isn't what I want, smh. I'll probs just release it and work on it later, else I'll never end up finishing lol.
```
        const circs = (/* page,*/ size, clx, cly, x, y, strk, fil, wl, wh, space/*, what */) => {
            for (let i = 0; i < wl; i += size * space) {
                for (let j = 0; j < wh; j += size * space) {
                    let circle = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "circle");
        
                    circle.setAttribute("cx", clx + i);

                    circle.setAttribute("stroke", strk);
                    circle.setAttribute("fill", fil);

Watching stuff w/Russian subtitles helps with figuring out what means what. And there are tutorials online. But mostly, it's just making phonetic connections to other languages and then putting it together after learning the basic alphabet. And then a bit of practising and you're good to go =P

I find it stupid how KA has multiple GQL endpoints when the _purpose_ of GQL is to have _one_ endpoint with a bunch of queries, smh. But they _are_ working to convert it to just one, so that's good, ig. Anyways, though, after they finish transferring, _none_ of the endpoints will be accessible from the KA CS projects (legally, at least) b'cuz CORS doesn't allow it. (Basically, no, not really. No usable endpoints.)

Oh, so we're gonna add the arms separate from the character function images? So the main characters are images but their limbs move using oop (if they have to pick up guns and do stuff)...?

So `image (graphics.[char], x, y, [width], [height])` but that only has the body + head, and then limbs that move using `lerp` and `sin` or whatever...?

Idk if this makes sense, sorry XP

Now, pancake, do you know how to make the loopy circle SVG function show up on different page divs (without affecting the previous children)? _Aurghhhhhh!_ If only that piece works the rest'll come easy XP

So a separate image object for the arms that we then rotate using trig whilst moving?

So you want a separate graphic for just the arms?
Also, shall they float along or do we need legs?

Oh, so you're thinking a weapon game where the guy shoots the gun and breaks out of the prison. I was thinking smthn more logic-heavy. Welp, they both sound good, although the shooting thing's a classic, so we might get more points for creativity.

Huh, if we're using guns but making them full-rigged, I suppose we're gonna need to animate individual joints.
And if we make them fully-rigged instead of the classic floaty-arms, we'll need to use OOP instead of literally translating images, right?

Oki.

Great :D
Agreed.
Which weapons? No guns, I presume, b'cuz _KA._ 
Control panels, oki, any particular size? I suppose we can always scale, but yeah. Any keys? To pick the first lock and escape? That can be the easy ones, the first level or so, and the doors get harder as they go. Harder ones like an escape room, with having to guess the right passcodes. Sorta like a mix between a platformer-ish-thing and a logic game, ig. Maybe?

Blocks? Like bricks? For a wall or smthn?

So, what _else_ is there to do? The homepage is mostly done, the only thing left is to change the content of the buttons, add the titles/some text, and shading, which won't take long at all. Now it's probably time for the main gameplay. _The Chase_ and _Breakout,_ right? So the robber's escaping jail. How should we go about that? :P
The logic's all yours, ofc. So any particular graphics you need? =P

Eep...
Apologies, but could you make a spinoff with the fixes? XP
Idk what you mean by "the argument 0" (`rectMode(0)`?) or which collision function (my one that's commented out or yours at the start of the program) or even why the draw worked b'cuz the `menuScene` had no content; it was all commented out, but the code worked, ish. The characters didn't show up, though.

How's the stuff looking, btw?

I got a 6.6 from JLE v(0-0)v
And then I asked why kinda annoyingly and subsequently got told off by Liam (which I needed tho, ngl) XD
So wonderful S. M. V. has gotten on the bad side of the judges lol

I'm currently revamping my subpage too; been meaning to do so for a while :P

And I'm quite happy I figured out how to loop SVGs c:
And I've made that into callable functions =P
Although the pages they're supposed to show up on aren't working, all of it is appending on the last-called page, so now I've gotta beg Mr Italics and pro gong player and bread for help lol
And the es6 page switch that was working 3 hours ago decided not to work and idk why, smh. But es5 is working, so... v(0-0)v

How's life?

Can you help me with the buttons? Why aren't they changing colour as the mouse hovers above them?
Sorry XP
(ooo but they are classes :D)

Here:
https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/6051327054757888

(btw, I have finished the characters, now I'm making a car and everything else better + easily usable

Although can we make the characters, like, not have legs XD
They look _really_ weird with them :P
Fits the style better w/out
And hovering arms
I originally did the sine walking thingy but it looked _weird_

And I suppose we can't include guns because _ThINK Of thE chILdrEN_ :o
Did you know those were called Studly caps? I just got bored and decided to make a horrible program that makes it like that a couple days ago :P)

----

_Edit:_
Still can't get that to work, but now why are the loaded images in the graphic object not having a cleared background? And even when it's an image, the random is going crazy (saving it separately didn't make it go insane). 
I'm sorry, this must make 0 sense XP
But it's in the link above =P

Ohh, that depends on what you wanna see. Like... City or nature, for example. Def take a visit to Cornwall, it's gorgeous! Idk how to surf, but the beaches are epic! Also, Seven Sisters park in Sussex is stunning! :D
For cities, Oxford is really pretty (and take a visit to London, too, ofc) and if ya go to Ireland, I love Dublin (really, the flight itself to Ireland is stunning [although we'd a private flight so the pilot was very lax and took a detour to show some really beautiful sights]).

My grammar was incorrect, apologies :)
Technically, stuff is uncountable, though, as the plural for stuff is not 'stuffs' but still 'stuff' :P

Yup!
Oh, that's a good idea.

Oh, wow. I love particle physics myself, although I don't suppose they teach that, eh... :P
Nice! :D

We don't _have_ letter grades :p
Although if you have a 93 + average the entire school year, you're on the A honour roll.
I'd say "yes" but that'd imply we're smart in the first place.
...I'm... I'm ah, not in Australia... o.O
We're tested at a young age and they identify you as G/T (or both like moi :p) and give you different classes/make you go to a different school. Although what I have is still stupid easy and I will rant for ages on its idiocy b'cuz I took a diagnostic (questions change based on skill level) and got up to Calculus (mostly multivariable calc and inner products of vectors), but ykw we're doing in class? _Systems of equations._ I fell asleep during maths and almost missed the bell, lol.

Oof XD
I think by "life" I just mean stuff to do lol
I've a credit exam the 17th, a competition the 18th, a plethora of quizzes/minor exams (like 12), 2 more midterms left, an essay, orchestra chair placements, a school dance I've gotta figure out how to avoid going to, meeting up at my friend's house to possibly build another bridge for the competition, a friend's b-day party, maybe actually study (who knows? _Perhaps_), another person's b-day, and... I think that's it.

Eh, I'm fine, thanks for asking =) 
Feb's a very busy month! Had a midterm, a maths exam, and an essay today. Chemistry test yesterday; class average was a 62% o.o 
I got a 97.1% so not bad; missed a single question and that's 'cuz I misclicked (...And didn't recheck my answers lol). Although, everyone < 80% fails b'cuz it's a "gifted & talented" school (beg to differ; we're all morons) so... Yeah. Many other stuff coming up this month, yay, I've a life for once =P

**scoffs** imagine _not_ having such a lack of a life that among your favourite forms of entertainment are changing bios **cough**
I changed it just before I saw this comment and idk what it was before anymore, lol. Kinda messed up a bit earlier on KA by "pestering" the CoC judges (- courtesy of Liam, lol, but I was curious as to why I lost points. And then didn't receive an answer, even when ik the person saw the notif. Seems a 'lil fishy if one takes off points and doesn't [can't?] explain why... In retrospect, ig I should've fought more but ehhh I'd just get even more on their bad side. Deleted the comments =P) XD

Heya again!
I'd hate to overload you, but is there any way you could make `randomSeed();` in ski.js? Or am I a moron (like I usually am) and is there a way to stop this without that?

This is why; lines 147-149.
And I'm sorry it looks absolutely awful. It should get better once I add in the characters and "juice it up" (ahem more like _steroid it up_ really) so to say =)

Oh, dear. Take a nice, long nap after, eh, m8?
Or, ya know, get a web dev. The balance will be skewed when HS gets kicked. 2 graphics, 2 game, 1 webpage. Balance :P
A hybrid game-web dev is the best choice, but with a lack of such, _[js object for completion/failure of an async op and its value]_ is perfect for this: decent and has not been selected yet. She can even get in some graphics if need be, perhaps. Just my thoughts, ofc, as always, final decision is yours, cap! (Or if you're busy and need me to search again, I will; looks like we think a bit on the same page based on your responses to my previous suggestions :D)

This must be getting redundant, but yeah, sucks again =/

Well, actually, that's not necessarily true (heh, unscrew back cover + battery, unplug power cord [connecting battery to motherboard],  hold the power button for, like, 20 secs, reconnect all the parts, and then do esc + refresh + power), but yeah, definitely don't screw with that, lol, you'll get flagged in the system. Bad consequences :P
Welp.

...
_Oki.
Now._
We've two weeks for the next challenge. We should not do what you did this time and release it last-minute. I'm sure you saw the ideas on GH, waitin' on your response; when you send it, have any ideas for graphics I should make? (Send there, ofc =p [< I totally stole this emoticon from Astro. Heya, Astro or Sprout if you stalk this! :D])

Hmm, as long as you haven't sold it or smthn, maybe...?
I wonder if there are any workarounds for changing permissions on a Chromebook (other than esc + refresh + power + ctrl d). Ig crosh is blocked and half the settings are greyed. It wouldn't show up on history, would it?

Aw, that sucks. 
(Neither can I though, not anymore, at least XD
Was just hoping you could lol)

Could you transfer all the files to the PC and go from there using the command line? Maybe over LAN or (preferably) USB hard drive?

Oh.
Well...
Do you have Linux on that Chromebook? 
If you didn't already, running command might help you:
```
$ ls /[directory name]
$ ls -a
$ ls -lt
```
_Should_ help you see files by last modified, iirc.

Or if it was backed up on a PC, dir command inside `cmd.exe`

`C:\> dir /o-d`

should also help you with that.
I think.
Idk.
Maybe?

Baking powder's the stuff that makes baked stuff rise lol
I'd be a 'lil concerned if that's what you put in your hot cocoa XD
Yeah. Awful. Idk what they do, it's disgusting and tasteless 
>=(

Well...
What if you go to repositories and sort by most recently updated? If you updated it last at midnight yesterday, that'd say smthn like "updated 17 hours ago" and you'd be able to see which one it is...? A private repo updated 17 hours ago. And then go from there? I presume you'd have already tried that, but... XP
Wait, it _is_ on GH, right?
Good :)

Idk if you have it in America, but just 100% pure baking cocoa from the brand _______ (if I tell you, you'd figure out where I live [and considering the fact you went onto a global weather website after hearing the temperature here, I wouldn't put it far past ya lol]). But definitely not a premade powder; those _suck._ Always need that S. M. V. touch, ya know? Strong (but not too strong!) on the cocoa, slightly on the lower side for sugar (compliments the "accessories" like whipped cream [although I didn't have a very fancy hot cocoa :p]). The _perfection_ ya can't find in a store-bought powder >=P

:D
Can't blame 'em, but yeah, it'd be quite sad.
_Wow..._ Idrk you but that sounds _exactly_ like smthn you'd do, lol XD

They're really not tho lol
As some brilliant person enunciated on _ski.js basix:_ "And the color... wow! It's like a light shade of lime, but more mellow and soft. And the white background gives it a good look."

In mine, it really does :P
(sure, GH at some point maybe lol)

Oh... [What reason? It's slightly painful to look at XD]

Sorry, typo; edited now. I'm actually quite a bit ahead of you, lol. 
(It ends at the same time tho no matter where you live, right? Midnight EST? Or was it MST? In which case it'd no longer be 3 hours, huh...)

Eh, curve vertexes seem like too much work if the result looks exactly like a rectangle with dots on its sides lol
Maybe a 'lil bit of inner detailing; a shadow or smthn, for the bedspread, too. Looks too simple. Definitely not bad, but maybe class it up (after finishing the base graphics in time, ofc, that's the most important part)
The rug looks cool tho :D
Well, I mean, yeah, you're right, just normal, but def not bad. Besides, you can't get particularly detailed with books. (**proceeds to make hyper-realistic but also cartoon book** _unless you're me, ofc_ >:3) If you want real, _savage_ criticism, like yours of my WCC webpage, try makin' a just graphic sometime :p

Yes, ofc, b'cuz I'm such a nice human being that way, right >:)))

Well, in all honesty... Over summer, I randomly found out I'd gotten un-childed, made a rickroll, felt bad it got on the HL, and then finally decided to make graphics because I'm too dumb for games (although ofc I'm planning on getting better and moving to more complicated stuff) XD

That's one of the fantastic things about ski.js: _fonts!_ (@ski can you hire me as marketing manager for ski.js lol) Like in an HTML program, you just import the font in a link in the head, and then when specifying the font as you would in a PJS program, use the imported font.
Ex:
```
[foo]
<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Garamond'rel='stylesheet'>

[foo]
<script>
    textFont(createFont("Garamond");
    text("heyo, :D! i'm mr savage ninja and i agree that S. M. V. is the best nicknamer in the world ;p", 10, 10, 300, 300);
</script>```
The text above will be in the font Garamond :D

Yup, the canvas API is where the graphics are drawn in JS and HTML.

ski.js is a library very similar to PJS. 
(Actually, even PJS is a library =P)
This project has an example of ski.js: https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/i/5422324483932160

Nah, not really. An example is instead of:
`var thing = function (x, y) {return x * y};`
you can do:
```const thing = (x, y) => {return x * y};`

My ninja program is PJS, yeah. Unfortunately whilst converting, my laptop had to do a mandated restart and I lost a ton of progress so I just kept it in PJS (I'd done it there and then converted).

Edit:
Oh, oops, looks like ski and I posted at the same time XP

Sometimes, there's really no meaning behind some stuff. Entropy always increases, right? It's like the chaos just built up to a point and then they do stupid stuff for no reason at all. Asking them is pointless. Adrenaline rush. Nothing was "wrong", they just _wanted_ to do it.
It's not anger, it's being human, then.
It's not anger to try and help someone get their grade up whilst keeping yours at a hundred. It's making them do what they _should_ be doing and motivating them. 
I hate false words of love because they're _never_ true. 
Tell me I suck and I'll get better. Tell me I'm good and I won't even try.

If you didn't get angry, where's the line between right and wrong going to be drawn? Laws exist to smooth down righteous anger. If there was no anger, why have laws? Why have stop signs, right? Oh, someone will die because the cars will crash into each other... But if people just got sad and not mad, not _angry,_ they wouldn't bother gaining justice; they'd just accept it and move on. The problem will never be fixed. Really, without anger, society is nothing. We would be at a point where nothing progresses. We _need_ it. 
We can't "forgive" someone if we are unable to recognise the mistake. How do we recognise a mistake? Because it makes someone angry. And that anger is justified. 
Forgiveness cannot come without sin and sin cannot be encountered without fury.

I'm not going to say anything about the rest of your message nor promote a discussion on religion on a learning website :P

Actually, snails and slugs evolved differently so even if you forcefully remove the shell from a snail, it's technically not a slug :P
Both are gastropods, though, and the basic separation is those without shells are slugs and those with shells are snails, so yeah :P

Dull lol no
That's what I was saying! You can control anger. But if you cease to get angry then you just won't be able to achieve something. Like if you're in a group and some people are just not doing anything, you have a right to express your anger (_without_ shouting at them) and make 'em do their work. If you don't get angry, would you tell them that? No. Why would you bother? You'd be _perfectly_ fine getting a 60 on the assignment, no? Anger is necessary _and_ healthy :p

Yup.
If you don't get angry at all, if their breaking all your stuff didn't make you mad, why would you patiently talk to them? Everything is perfect, right? You're not mad about anything! So why'd you bother talking to them in the first place?

:P

Yeah, the world sucks

...Therefore, even by having controlled anger, you are still technically getting angry; your point is null and void :P

Oh, I'd never blow up in their face! Just take them aside and calmly explain why what they did was wrong, they were a moron, and to never do it again. I mean, I'm still angry, but I express it in a way that is efficiently sharing what I feel whilst not exploding, lol.

Actually, you're really good at the genuine rapping part, too, despite your insistence.
(Went from _"not_ bad" to "really good" b'cuz, after an attempt myself, my respect for how quickly that was articulated by you shot up xD)

The way you say _mate_ tho lol

The _lies_ part, and the final _my bad_ were awesome, as was the beat (ik I said this a plethora of times, but...) :D
Did you choose the beat after writing the rap or before? 'Cuz the rhythm...?

You being American, I shouldn't have been surprised by your American accent, but you have a very American American accent, _lol_ =P

Also, the way you actually put feeling/expression into the words whilst rapping it was gud :o

_Nice jobbbb_

Flagged for plagiarism.
Writing "based on" is not enough.
Astro (who can _totally_ kill a bear with his bare hands, xD) made the original: https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/inverted-game/4528683517263872

Please do not just steal code. Votes are nothing unless you earn them. Plagiarism is just a worthless burst of dopamine that, should you so valiantly desire, can be retained simply by having a piece of chocolate. Learning, on the other hand, is a much more long-lasting form of dopamine... So I suggest you take up on that, oki? :)

Sorry, lol...

I'm asking 'cuz you haven't responded [to me] in a few hours on either account and sent me a link to this program titled "i just wanna ruin someone's day"...
Am I that "someone", in specific?
Are the top lines just generally ski-ish, or were they actually kinda aimed towards me?
Is the "greatest graphics" part also s'posed to offend me ('cuz you specifically randomly sent me [a graphic-maker] this link, when, clearly, you don't need any help with the dino, and certainly not the sprite code ["what do you think of the dino an' the sprite algorithm?"])?

Efficiency: 3 
_Too simple for much judging regarding efficiency, but you repeat the colours a bit, so save 'em as a variable or in an array. There are easier ways to use complex shapes as well; you can use `bezierVertex` + normal `vertex` to shorten the code by a lot._

Idk why what you're doing is not working, and my "fix" is stupid, so I'm gonna try and figure out why yours is not

can you make a list of all requests for features/bugz for ski.js as well as any additional but not essential tasks that have been asked of me?"

So, I'm finally gonna start on this, lol. 
(You're the manager and ig rn I'm acting like your secretary, lol... Or is it a slave, 'cuz I'm not paid? o.O)

But before that, so the stuff is actually up-to-date, what version am I supposed to use now?
~ DATE: 3/27/2023, 6:39:44 PM ~
_Ooh,_ it'd be cool if you make a renewed version of this, with the people who are active now =P

_Pink flowers?_ xD
And the header font is weird-looking, maybe try a classic serif [but bolded] as opposed to a display serif? 

The info is great and extremely useful, thanks, will probs use at some point in the future :D

Yay, mr savage ninja, this looks awesome! :DDD
Goodness, were you seriously doing this 'til 1 AM your time last night?
Take care of yourself, oki, please? Idk how you're surviving, and I feel kinda guilty for being harsh (although idk if I'd take it back, 'cuz it seems to have worked :p), so here's some of my fantastic hot cocoa: ? =p
Yesyesyes, this'll be one of the best games on KA, no cap :D

So for the challenge with multiple-programs, I just told someone they're each worth 10 pts, just letting you know, lol. Also, if you could make the entry thread for the _No I in Team_ challenge, that'd be great [you've done the other ones, so might look better if you do it ;p].

At this point, you can just disregard me for judging, I'm so sorry. I'll try, but I'm too busy irl :(

_Awww_, now _that's_ a freakin' _adorable_ character, just look at that teeny smile, awww, fantastic job! The only critique I'd say is the feet look too pointy; perhaps round 'em off a 'lil? Also, how will the chap climb up the ladder? Maybe make arm movement dudez, too?

- `b.split("")` is entirely unnecessary
- `random` doesn't work outside of here which is why I used `Math.random()` :p

I know I'm late, but you literally copied someone else's code, changed a few colours, and then added ellipses onto the right eye. I do not at _all_ believe this deserves 27 votes (1/3rd of the original), but I am not going to flag it. However, the next time you _conveniently_ forget to make a spinoff, you'll most certainly get flagged, so _please_ give due credit; putting a link at the top _does not count_ as such. If you can find the time to copy and paste into a new program, surely you're capable of finding the juicy blue button at the bottom-right of the program titled "Spin-off"? 

Remember: don't code for votes. Code for yourself. Code to improve. Oki? Good luck :)

That pixel art is pretty freakin' sweet :o

It could use a 'lil colour tho, the background's an easy fix for that, maybe make it blue instead of grey?
It'd be better with a 'lil more juicing, as Longtreader said. Also a menu page and the like would help :p

This is an awesome graphic :D
Although, you drew out _every, single_ vertex? I could never have enough patience to do that... That's why I use loops _inside_ of `beginShape`/`endShape` =D

Oh, if you're using the bricks like this, on line 771, change the `let rndm = 80 + random (80)` to `let rndm = 70 + random (45)` because it looks _awful_ atm. I'm not gonna say anything else rn b'cuz you're clearly not done :)

Yeah, life sucks sometimes
Like lollipops
Both sweet and sucky at the same time

(...If it's currently sucky, it'll _have_ to stop sucking b'cuz you'll eventually be left with the weird stick thingy that you _can't_ suck so you'll have to get another lolly to suck but then things are sweet again :p)

So moral: life sucks like a lollipop but it'll get better and sweeter again :)

_A savage ninja!
And `POSTERIZE`!
Two of my favourite things!_

Fantastic job :DDD

I'll let you smart guys -Mr Italics, Sprout, _bread_- do your thing with efficiency and whatnot, meanwhile, I'll just revel in the savage-ninja-iness of the image the one and only, legendary mr savage ninja chose :D

Ah, interesting.
May I ask why we _want_ a beginner?
"2 graphic dev, 3 game devs, 1 beginner"

And why no other web devs? 
You'd said everybody might be going out of their comfort zone (or something along those lines) earlier on GH, so if there were more webpages to be made, perhaps another person decent at that instead of a beginner?

Sorry, I must be very annoying right now (and honestly in general, eh, mr savage ninja) to be questioning your decisions. Trust ya enough to at least _hope_ you know what you're doing, just curious as to the reasoning behind it =P

You replaced the trees! :D
Although, you should probably take off cool guy coding's name saying he made 'em, XD

Also, on line 138, could you replace it with `ellipse (random (100, 180) + random(25)*sin(frameCount*random(5)), random (200, 20), rndm, rndm);`?  Sorry XP

**aggressively spam-clicks to watch sword go _boing**_
Lookin' good! 
The tree trunks are rather disproportionate, though. And inefficiently done.
=/

Here, replace the inside of the tree function with:
```
    pushMatrix();
    scale(s/80);
    translate(x, y);
    
    noStroke();
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 30; i+= 10) 
    {
        fill (0 + i*3, 0, 0);
        rect (100 + i, 140, i, 208);
    }
    
    for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) 
    {
        var rndm = random(20, 80);
        fill (0, 100 + i*0.8, 0);
        ellipse (random (100, 180)+random(5)*sin(frameCount*random(5)), random (200, 20), rndm, rndm);
    }
    
    popMatrix();
```
and then add `randomSeed(1);` to the draw function and tell me what ya think... =P

Is this the collab you and DR are doing? =P
Looks cool :D
(Random thought... Ya know how the dirt blocks' lines look like they say RM? What if you change the vertexes [lines 296-309] to smthn looking like your logo? Instead of RM, maybe DR x LG? Idk if that makes sense, but... :p)

_The good stuff:_
Not bad! The nav-bar opening is nice, as are the page fade-in animations =)

_Critiques (sorry, but had to be done XP):_
- Why are the images completely unrelated to the content? 
(Ex: trees for internet, volcano for airplanes, snow for slinkies, beach for microwaves, another volcano for biscuits, grass for robots, and a galaxy for computers)
- On the nav-bar, the words only show up if you hover _directly_ over them. It's honestly very awkward and not very user-friendly.
- The fonts. 'Nuff said. They're... Not good, to say the least.
- On the learning page, whilst hovering over them, they become half transparent and that also looks very awkward. It's also a little confusing, as I expected to be taken to another page if I click it (which is what one would think with a hover animation. Or perhaps I'm just an idiot... v(0-0)v)

Hi! 
Sorry, I'm a bit of a moron, lol.
You've won for Caela! Amazing job! And for Pruina!
But... As the colours don't contrast with the background, could you make the `background (0, 0);`? Don't worry, you don't need to change anything about the avatars... They're looking great! I'm going to change the background of the images whilst inserting them into the page so they contrast a bit, enough to see well. Idk if this makes any sense, and I'm really sorry for the confusion (wow, I'm a horrible host lol), but could you set the background as that for all the avatars?

*New thread*

_Same rules apply as 1st thread._

...
Note: If you join this thread, be prepared for a _lot_ of notifications XP

...
*A quick disclaimer for fl@g-happy people*
_Technically, this is not violating any rules._

They are as follows:

"Fl@g as abuse
disrespectful or offensive, an advertisement

Fl@g as a question
Should be in ?Questions?

Fl@g as not helpful
Low quality, not about the video topic, soliciting votes or seeking badges, a homework question, repeatedly making the same post

Fl@g as about the site
A question about Khan Academy (e.g. ?What software does Sal use??), a post about badges, a technical problem with the site, a request for videos or features"

_Although certain parts of this thread go off-topic, it clearly does not violate anything above._

Furthermore, in the guidelines it says:
"...Social groups or clubs, or projects that generate social chats, and other posts not related to coding, in the discussion thread..."

_This is regarding the project getting hidden on the HL. This is -not- on the HL. No problem there!
Neither the guidelines nor fl@gs explicitly state anything to do with off-topic discussion *threads* so it can all be left up to viewer interpretation, making it somewhat easy to argue oneself out of a possible mess..._ >;D

Okay. We need a 'teams' page. It was a little confusing to read this, and when I'm converting this to a webpage (adding the main content rn), I think it's pretty much necessary to have all the information complete XP

Just give me these and I'll fill in the rest. 
- How many teams are there? 
- What are their names? 
- Are we really doing this avatar contest? 
- What is our fallback if we don't get entries? 

We need all these planned out before going ahead. On your subpage, maybe, could you post an announcement for avatars? Idk. We need entries. 
Furthermore, depending on how many people join, 12 judges seem... More than a little extra. If you changed the number because of me or smthn, I'm totally okay with not judging. Even TCW, with 53 participants has only 5 judges; 4 alternating. So, it might not be feasible to have 12. We've also got to factor in the dreaded inactivity... o.o

Atop this, I have one more question. Are the points by team or individual members?

Edit: ACTUALLY, you know what we should do?! Along with the homepage challenge, make it a homepage AND avatar challenge! That'd be two birds with one stone, so to say! :D
We should give 'em team names and then make 'em come up with an avatar for them. But we should allow avatar submissions early. Or just keep them separate... Actually, I think I know what to do >:)
But would you rather I reroute them to your page for the avatar contest or have entries in mine? I think it might be best to do a combination of the two; if you get entries (you said you'd only gotten one, hence why I'm asking here as well XP), could you send them to me, so they're all in one area, or vice versa?

I'm sorry, it's extremely late here, I have no idea if anything I said made sense, I'll check back next in a coherent manner...

Oh, random, and about 5 days late (judging this rn, actually, for TCW), but about the grey colour thing, you could save the colour as a variable and when trying to find the colour just use the variable instead.

```
var g = color (r, g, b [< fill these with the rgb colour value]);

[loads of code to otherwise inefficiently search through]

fill (g);
[shape code & whatever]

Oh, this is stunning! C'est _tres_ bien! Et... Parlez vous francais? 
...Anyways, absolutely love it; amazing job! 
My favourite part is honestly probably the balcony's railings and the tree's leaves, as well as pretty much the intricacy. Although, for the future, it would probably be more efficient to put the background building in a loop :P 
Awesome job, again!

The lyrics, though, they got me in a twist.

(Edit: Just realised I'm supposed to be judging this XD... O.O)

Whoa, whoa, whoa. How have I not voted this up yet?!

This is absolutely, amazingly, stunningly, jaw-dropping. I know I'm certainly late to the party; by half a year, lol, but I'm still gonna give a full description of the awesomeness:

- The textures in the clothing are fantastic. The trousers' shading is super realistic, and the jacket... **chef's kiss**
- The background is also awesome!
- I love the hazy feel behind the words
- The way the words curve and the placing and everything is perfectly done.
- _The logo. The webs. The shoes. The hands. Everything!_ Un-be-lie-vable o.o

You could earn some big bucks doing this for a video game company or something :P

Once again, amazing job!

I do have one comment though- for the sake of efficiency, instead of coding out every single vertex, it might be easier to use a for loop, especially for the more intricate parts :P

I personally prefer autumn and the left side. But it's up to you =)

I'll work on mine on my own program and in the end, we can add 'em together.

What's the most random thing you've heard someone say?

So a circle guy with eyes
Should I make multiple characters with different skin/hair/eye colours? 
(Cuz RPG, so players can choose their own characters)

And it's not that bad for midnight XD
I probably shouldn't be on here at 5 AM many days myself, though XD

I'll do the characters first (before the scenery) so you can work on the animations

Hmm...
Random question! (Or _thought_, I suppose, is more like it, lol...)

What was there before everything?
Nothing, right?
That means _nothing_ existed.
'Nothing' _can't_ exist, though.
So wouldn't that make 'nothing' a paradox?

...
Also, I'm thinking of making a self-portrait, what do you guys think?

Actually, out of curiosity, what do you guys think I look like?

Edit: Whooooo I'm exactly 60% of the way to my goallllll! =D

I think it might be more of a primitive response. Ya know? When fish are feeling threatened, they contort their body into a c-shape, which automatically propels them up. Fish all the way down in the sea don't seem to have this ability; only surface-level fish. So if they do it, they automatically go into the air cuz that's how their body works. And like @ski and @br?nte said, they might be able to find out the temperature or pressure change. Also, the fact they won't be able to breathe... 

IDK. Just a theory. Like humans getting goosebumps, just a flight-or-fight response.

What if dogs bring us back sticks cuz they think we like throwing them?

Do you like MBTI? I'm an INTJ :D

Well... Observe programs of others and try to see what they do :)
Learn masking, noise, complex shapes, and functions like that. I don't want to give all my secrets (;p), but improvise. Try to reduce the number of lines while maintaining quality. Really scrutinise your projects and make sure all the colours flow nicely. I like to use `lerpColor` or take everything from the same base array of colours to make it look even better.

(For the record, I do happen to have ADHD, _lol)_

Using the distributive property, we can go from 
(fx + g)(hx + j) 
to 
(fh)x? + (fj + gh)x + gj

1. fx ? hx = fhx?.
2. fx ? j = fjx.
3. g ? hx = ghx.
4. g ? j = gj.
At this point, we have all four... Segments, with lack of a better word... Of our expression written:
fhx? + fjx + ghx + gj
From here, we can factor out the x.
(fh)x? + (fj + gh)x + gj
Now, at the beginning of the video, we had the variables a and b. Let's replace the fj and gh with them.
a = fj
b = gh
Therefore, a ? b will be equal to fj ? gh, which we could then rewrite as fhgj, also equal to (fh)(gj).
Now, let's refer back to the first, unfactored expression we had:
fhx? + fjx + ghx + gj
Now that we have (fh)(gj), when looking back at the previous expression, we can see it is the first coefficient (fh) times the constant term (gj).
So, 
a [aka fj] + b [aka gh] = middle term [fj + gh]
Using the commutative property of multiplication, we can reorder the fjgh to see that
a [aka fj] ? b [aka gh] = first coefficient ? constant term
And this is why it all works out in the end.

Hope this helps!
(actually, I hope it's _coherent_ in the first place, lol XD)

Nope, it stands for Processing JavaScript, the highly inefficient (albeit great starting point) language KA uses. It's significantly different from Java Script and not used much in real life.

The basic HTML takes only, like, 30 minutes; HTML is a very simple language. Adding in the actual content, as opposed to lorem ipsum; let's say an hour. The CSS? Another hour. Let's throw in another half an hour for learning and double-checking; etc. So maybe 3 hours total. But I've been told I'm a fast coder, so idk.

Well, this is probably just me, but I learned HTML and CSS in a day. I had no school and was _super_ bored, so I watched all the KA videos on x2 speed and raced through the challenges, XD

Well, this is probably just me, but I learned HTML and CSS in a day. I had no school and was _super_ bored, so I watched all the KA videos on x2 speed and raced through the challenges, XD

You simply forgot to define variable t.
Just add
```var t = 0.01;```to the start, and it'll work like a charm :)

The thing is, I saw how you defined all the variables outside, in the 'variables' section, but that won't work, because the map is inside a named function, so the global variables don't have a scope inside 'em.
