I would like to continue as well. 

Activity wasn't what hurt the collaboration between the 21262 and me, it was time zones.

Currently the only thing you can help wiht is adding a couple more scenrios. . . better a late entry than no entry ig.
• DATE: 2/11/2023, 8:39:35 AM
Currently, I should be able to output a version of it by Monday if nothing goes seriously wrong. It is not by any means visually appealing right now (I hope to change that), but the back end is mostly done and if I can add enough events, choices, and random events it should be a fun game.
• DATE: 2/9/2023, 6:24:46 AM
So, I imported ski.js to make it easier to work with for the game, but whenever I type something in it always reverts back to the menu scene and I cant figure out how to stop it. Do you know how?
• DATE: 2/8/2023, 6:34:42 AM
Each player turn goes something like this:
You are faced with an event. (e.g. you have a choice to cross a river)
You decide what to do about the event (you press 1 to cross or 2 to not cross [number keys])
The game responds to your actions (you made it across, or perhaps you died)
(This one isn't in the game, but I think would make it more fun) A random event occurs (thieves steal your luggage, or you come across some random bullets)
• DATE: 2/7/2023, 4:43:48 PM
I am working on the backbone of the game (other than the HTML side), and I should have it done by the end of Wednesday. We don't have the time to do a complex game, so we'll have to make a simple but clean output.
• DATE: 2/6/2023, 9:15:11 PM
I made a basic layout uptop for the game (just for me to visualize what it _might_ look like). :)
• DATE: 2/6/2023, 7:57:26 PM
Great! I need to go (its about 8 pm my time), but I should be back on in about an hour. :)

@OregonTrail:
Its a game where people pretend the are on an adventure going West during the 1800s int eh United States (look up Oregon Trail game for more)

If it that doesn't work, you should just get started on a webpage of your choosing and i'll see how I can get involved with it.

sorry, I've had a busy past week/weekend and haven't hade time to start working. I should be able to work more this week.
• DATE: 2/5/2023, 7:57:00 PM
Maybe, we should do the Oregon Trail? The basics shouldn't be hard, and has a large potential.

Could you create a website advertising the WNET? I'll get to work on some of the games, stores, and other stuff hopefully today.
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 10:20:15 AM
But what?
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 6:27:34 AM
You should be able to kill a couple weak monsters by sword (clicking), and then to kill the other monsters, you will want to visit the shop (shift) to get upgrades.
• DATE: 2/2/2023, 6:24:44 AM
Not  really. This is actually an old idea I adopted to our situation.
• DATE: 2/1/2023, 7:37:02 PM
Its basically a mini-recreation of the internet (7-8 Websites), but everywhere you go something strange happens e.g. a website where you play a dodge game will randomly send a nuke at you that kills you.
• DATE: 2/1/2023, 10:23:54 AM
So you'll create a website endorsing a new internet, and i'll create the 'new' internet in PJS. If you have any other ideas, please suggest them, because this is a pretty weak one.
• DATE: 2/1/2023, 10:22:30 AM
The only problem I have with that is how to integrate the PJS with the HTML.
• DATE: 1/31/2023, 9:19:41 PM
Let's just stick with what Mojo1000 suggested then.

Game coders know a thing or two about that too. lol

Well . . . its supposed to be one of the top schools in America (sometimes ranked number 1, a couple years ago number 4, back up, now its at number 8), so I *hope* that none of the half-witted students make it in. I mean when you get 15 million dollars in scholarship and have a 1401 average SAT, half-witted students don't really fit in.
• DATE: 1/27/2023, 6:20:24 AM
It depends on what you are making, the way this background is made it usually puts out a good background entirely random. The reason for this is that I take a 50*50 square and then rotate it by different angles across the screen. If you hit the restart button a few times you might be able to see what look like 'arrows' pointing to the top-right corner. As for random seed vs. set background. I would go with set background because you cannot undo a random seed. This is hurtful when deciding chances e.g. (critical attack or which arm of a monster should attack) that should not be controlled by a random seed. On the other hand if you are doing a still graphic, randomseed may be easier than doing an entirely set graphic.
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 9:33:42 PM
so am I. lol I have that feeling a game coder gets when they look at the game they created, and think it is utter garbage.

I have an 'evaluation' for a magnet school (if I said which it would give away my location) in 2 days. I absolutely hate irl school. Its a dumb waste of time, I get so bored all throughout class, but I still have straight 100+s . . . i hate school lol.
• DATE: 1/26/2023, 9:24:38 PM
Emojis are usually frowned upon in the coding community because they look different on different computers, and the general lack of effort in the graphics. For example, my guess is you have a WindowsOS (not sure) where the emojis look okay. However, on my school Chromebook, they actually look quite horrid.

Just some tips. :)

actually no. They merely are better at games and graphics, than ski has shown. However 'operation flash' among other program shows that ski's claim to fame was never games or graphics. Its building PJS almost from scratch in HTML, making thumbnails crazy easy and reliable in HTML, allowing near instant communication among other things. See my point? ski never said he was the best game or graphic dev on KA. And if I may that was a very immature insult. We weren't even talking about ski, and then again you rekindle old flames.

2. There is a couple things ski never does. I am his brother, so I would know. One of them is rekindling old fights unprovoked. Why jump in on the thread trying to rekindle old fights, when ski had turned the conversation to the scum on the top of the hot list right now, and then you turn it back to the original topic, all while ski 'disrespectful and hypocritical'? I refuse to let my brother just be attacked in such a way.

3. Did I mention there are a few things ski never does? One of them is he never apologizes if he doesn't want too. Trust me, I have tried to wrench an apology from him on multiple occasions and he refused. The bottom line is that ski most likely will refuse to apologize, in that microscopic chance that he does lose.
• DATE: 10/8/2022, 7:20:18 PM

a.) the program intentionally or unintentionally was very much of a gimmick to get votes, it wasn't well made, didn't actually honor anybody imo, and got a crazy number of votes.

b.) the second program was labeled 'too controversial' after people from the first program ranted on a quite neutral and actually supportive post from ski.
• DATE: 10/7/2022, 2:47:22 PM
@lazerbrain:
a.)
I'm sure ski would be glad to fix the bug.

I have a couple clues:

b.) not new

c.) TDJ noted your style is similar to that of LtCD's which could mean that you are LtCD whom deleed his account and thus explains this new account and the ridiculous graphic. However, I have my doubts that you are LtCD because the apple program is too simplistic/realistic to be LtCD.

nah, i actually don't. i merely here ski rant all day and night, about how easy it is to fix all these bugs, and what they are . . . and if he isn't talking about those bugs, that means he has a bug in one of his programs and wants my help as if I know more than he does. XD
• DATE: 8/18/2022, 9:51:30 AM
not sure about this _specific_ bug being one line, (extremly simple though), but many bugs like the bug where PJS programs don't load properly (where the project loads in a 100 x 100 canvas), and the one where all HTML programs, even if they don't need it, have scroll bars, are both one-liners that the KA devs themselves made, the KACP has pointed out, and have not been fixed yet. This happens so frequently, as alluded to above, that the KACP has a running joke about the 'monthly KA bug'. Usually the KACP finds a way to fix it, and uses that until the bugs are fixed, if ever.
a list of bugs not fixed with their solutions:
```
the current settings bug -> utiliza the console using a method, created by my brother ski just today. if you want I can provide a link
```
```
100 x 100 PJS canvas bug -> createGraphics([desired width], [desired height], P2D)
```
```
impeccable scroll bar in HTML -> again ski found a way to fix it. i will send you the link if you request it. (too long to be put here)
```
```
impeccable scroll bar in PJS -> none known fix currently
```
Also to prove they are one-liners the following is the replacement code for the scrollbar bug.
```
overflow-y: auto
```

transliteration: ski only leaves negative comments, not because he _is_ negative, but because he only commments when there is something negative to say. Leave other people to be positive , ski will show people what they don't want to see. Afterwards a whole bunch of people (usually noobs) then rant about how he is never leaves positive comments (even though he does like programs) and says he stirs up arguments, and then in effect stir up an argument, and continue arguing even when he tries to stop . . . happened more than once.

        fill((i + j) % 2 ? color(0, 10) : color(255, 10));

I wouldn't suggest deletin' your account as a lot of people would like to see your projects, and they would disappear if you deleted your account.

Also, might want to talk to ski about errors in the console if that doesn't work, he knows more about this sort of thing than I do. :D
• DATE: 8/12/2022, 7:11:28 AM
Lol, oh also to correctly answer your question about maksing to ski, (on this program) you _can_ use masking outside of the static enviornment like this. (You have to do this because of a KA bug.)
`````
if(img){
img.mask(image);
}
`````
However, _getting_ an image inside the draw function is extremly laggy, thus my answer, and ski's.
• DATE: 8/12/2022, 7:07:29 AM
(sorry for the long response time)

ah, okay.

sure! (i might be less actibe once school starts though.)

Some other things to note:
a.) emoji's though helpful in some circumstances, are actually a bad practice because of the way they show up on different computers, some computers will show the emoji's up fine, some will show the emoji's but squished, and some older computers will have no idea what an emoji is and go bonkers. However, emojis have been used for graphical purposes by well-known graphics creators. Just a thought to keep in mind. :)

b.)
I would highly recommend that you use proper grammar (in your projects), as it looks more prefessional, and a portion of people do not know 'text slang', while others just find it anoying. However to some extent they are okay, because my brother, ski, has cosistently refused to uppercase his letters in his projects, and use apostrophes consistently where they are unneccesary.
• DATE: 8/12/2022, 6:56:35 AM
I looked through his projects and he poats something similar on every single one of his programs though most of the time, he will say something to the sort of 'I hope you have a wonderful day.' Each time he makes alterations to the message, but most of the time (one exception) the general idea stays the same.

To clear it up, if >50% of the program is not created by you, you must spin-off. Also, the words 'no credit needed' are ruled useless by the guidelines which say that credit _must_ be given no matter how small. Thus this program is plaigarism and should be flagged for gaurdians to view. :)
• DATE: 8/11/2022, 9:15:28 AM
I'm going to flag for plaigarism, but cet2009, it is also against the guidelines to 'repeatedly making the same post'. If you could remove all but one of your comments that say 'Don't plaigarise!' that would be nice . :) Also it is spelled plagarize.

Nikola Tesla once said that Edison wasn't as bright as some claimed he was. To illustrate he said that instead of taking a magnet to find a needle in a haystack, Edison would individually go through each piece of hay until he found the needle. Why is this important to this discussion?
Because both ways would work, and Edison would be able to brag about how long he spent searching for the needle, though most of it was unneccessary. Thus >1000 lines of code should mean squat to everybody.

look up 'line collisions in java script' and it should get you some results that work. Then you simply make it into a function that returns true if colliding and false otherwise, and then if the function is true for the line you stated plus a line that acts as the border of the wall, then 'end = true'

Plus ski, recently (yesterday) got it up and running on a CDN so it doesn't take up unneccessary lines of code! Not to mention the fact that you can use ski.js alongside ES6+ syntax that makes everything faster, more efficient, and altogether shorter.

Agreed, the technical wording of 'personal' does not fit the program, but then what is the point? KA wants their platform to be a place to learn, not to become a social media platform. Heck, they would get a lot more money, but that isn't the purpose.

I do not mean to be disrepectful to Apex, but I would have to say it wasn't meant for KA (unless it follows second sentence after this). Again, KA is a place to learn, not a social media platform. Also I am not sure if this would fit Apex's program, but making a program _because_ someone died, is very different than making a program _about_ someone dying. This program's sole purpose is to be _about_ the issue. I do not know Apex's program, but it could be he made the program, and made it _because_ his grandmother passed away, and left comments in the code about it, etc, but it had a purpose other than to just let people know somebody died. Like this program.

Again, I do not know the program so I cannot say. (also, I ain't the end all be all, and I can be totally wrong, this is just my perspective)
• DATE: 8/4/2022, 9:55:54 AM
@FSoM:
Not to be rude, but how would you define it? Though the technical definition of 'personal' issue, does not fit this program, the general idea of the fact they do not want people posting what is going on in their life instead of learning, fits this catergory. :)
• DATE: 8/4/2022, 9:21:32 AM
Hit the flag button on the program, and look at the button off-topic's description. The last thing it says is 'personal issues', and this program is very much about personal issues. from there you can read ski's comment that Qwerty understands this and defies the guidelines, and thus as a KA user under the Guidelines I must flag.
• DATE: 8/4/2022, 6:57:43 AM

• DATE: 8/1/2022, 6:17:11 PM
ah, i have heard about it before. I am not sure if that is what I was talking about, I was more looking for rotated rect to rotated rect collisions, where it doesn't merely just detect if it is colliding, but pushes the rects so that they stay apart, if that makes any sense. It appears that your verlet intergration only detects collisons between borders and the figures. :D (ski yells at me when I call it collisons)
• DATE: 8/1/2022, 2:37:58 PM
ah, that is what I do too, but for certain things where you need coordinates, for example a game where you swing back and forth, you can't simply 'rotate' the player to get coordinates, thus the function. I am currently building an animation rig where the character's hands swing back and forth, thus the program.

are you asking how to mask?
• DATE: 7/28/2022, 9:57:57 AM
a.) Gray Wolf is a he. :P

b.) lol, ski can crash a browser (which he has threatened to do on multiple occasions), create a nearly infinite stream of spin-offs, can quickly collect a lot of data from KA using their API (what Gray Wolf does), and more. But ski isn't the most knowledgable in all realms either, when it comes to coding knowledge, Aliquis, Bob Lyon, and Henry also know a lot. Also, Vexcess, who used to be on KA, knows a lot more than ski. I forgot whom, but somebody on KA was able to tell you which browser you were on, your battery level, and a bunch of other freaky stuff.

ski used to have websites that rivalled (and according to him beat) Gray Wolf's but he was banned for a time, so you can no longer see them, he also has a ton more games than you currently cannot see, cus he was banned. Also, honestly, sometimes Gray Wolf's projects feel redundant, for a time he almost constantly produced mobile games, that even i could do, just with better graphics. Could be me being jealous of his fan base, but honestly that is just how i feel.

If you like Gray Wolf's API stuff you may want to look at Khanalytics. Aliquis can probably help you better than I can, if you are asking about API, etc.

`sq.constructor("return BigInt")();`

lol, both of us have improved a lot, i mainly have improved in making animations and games, while he has become a legend at all three languages that KA offers, and is currently learning Python and C++. today he goes by the name of ski.

teams actually lost traction a little after you left, currently the rage is contests, e.g. Clash of Code that ended in May, Primavera that ended a couple weeks ago, The Coding Olympics and The Coder's Cup that are currently going on. Those are the bigger of the contests going on, there are also many logo and smaller contests that take place. Teams have been replaced by a temporary team that try to win competitions, thus the disappearence of them. Also, the surviving teams break apart easily because of in-fighting or inactivity. The latter of which has recently been affecting the contests.

I am not the contest creator, but I think that you can. The reason being is that any entry to the contest does not _need_ to fit the theme, thus I do not think the contest creators will throw a fit over you making a simulation/interactive program that might not fit most defenitions of the theme.

the enemies. here is what i copied and pasted from a post i sent to jake k. before i realized i had already told him about it.

b.) this is the current missile collisions
not all enemies are the same size so the `<50` doesn't work

dist(enemies[i].x, enemies[i].y, this.x, this.y) < 50 && this.type === 'missile'

c.) we need to add size attributes to every object for the projectiles in the projectiles stats.

d.) when i add that i get this piece of code that breaks the game

dist(enemies[i].x, enemies[i].y, this.x, this.y) < (this.size / 2) + (enemies[i].size / 2) && this.type === 'missile'

Not related to this program, but I have a question.

I have a method that converts integer strings to binary and binary strings to integer. It works for smaller numbers, 1, 7, 100, 1000, etc. However I need the convertors to work for larger numbers (see the second number in the println), and it does not work for numbers beyond a certain point, because part of the number is lost in one or both of the convertors (note the end of the first and third numbers in the println). Can you explain what is going on, and if you know a way to fix the problem?

Neat hyperlinks! I like the colors you put into it, very appealing. I liked the veteran's day one, but couldn't comment. By the way, I was just talking to someone else on this, emojis and text images are usually seen as low quality as they are simply getting a picture from a store of characters. They are also not compatible across different computers, so say somebody looking at with a Chromebook would see it differently than somebody with a Macbook. ;)

Two bugs/issues:
1: The tracks when the cube goes forward are the same as going backward.
2: The map does something weird when you get reset. If you don't know how to fix it easily then you could make another screen go over it. (The screen thing might be on purpose).

Overall great project! I will wait patiently for the final product. :)

b.) should we making this game relying on outside PJS-like libraries or just in JS?

c.) how do you get scripts to work with the HTML? e.g. getting a variable to show up on the screen as part of a header or paragraph text.

If we can get these 3 things figured out we should be good for all the basics.

Neat! By the way you don't have to keep making seperate variables if you use objects e.g.
``````````
    var candleX1 = 244;
    var candleY1 = 142;
    var candleX2 = 272;
    var candleY2 = 162;
    var candleX3 = 300;
    var candleY3 = 142;

`````````
becomes
`````````
var candle = {
    left: {
      x: 244,
      y: 244,
    },
    middle: {
    x: 272,
    y: 162
    },
    right:{
    x: 300,
    y: 142
    },
};

then you can call the variables like this.

candles.left.x
`````````

Hope this helps you! :D

However you _can_ create a new webpage and then copy/paste the code there, _but_ it is no longer a spin-off of the original project. You will not be able to win.

b.) this is the current missile collisions
`
dist(enemies[i].x, enemies[i].y, this.x, this.y) < 50 && this.type === 'missile'
`
c.) we need to add size attributes to every object for the projectiles in the projectiles stats.

d.) when i add that i get this piece of code that breaks the game
`
dist(enemies[i].x, enemies[i].y, this.x, this.y) < (this.size / 2) + (enemies[i].size / 2) && this.type === 'missile'

• DATE: 5/25/2022, 9:36:59 AM
lol I found a bug in my code, and a way to fix it.

a.) the bug happens when you get to the end of the route with a splitter, so basically you need another boolean that way something like this (see if statement below) happens, and the `enemies[i].end` only comes true when the enemy is at the end of the track (line 360). this should fix it! :)

(line 454)
if((enemies[i].dead && enemies[i].type !== 'split') || enemies[i].end)

• DATE: 5/17/2022, 7:16:35 AM
okay, remember that one time that I criticized your program? well here goes a, hopefully nicer, constructive criticism of your program.

a.) there is a bug when you hit the UP key and then press any other key, the top says scrunched, don't know why that happens

b.) the draw function, imo, would be obsolete with the following line of code
`
var thumb = thumb + 1 | 0;

    image(thing, 0, 25);

    if(thumb > 10){
        var thumbnail = get();
        background(0);
        image(thumbnail, 50, -28, 300, 657);
    }
`
which basically says that if you have restarted the program 10 or more times then show the thumbnail, else if there are any normal person, show the normal graphic, this also (should) fix the bug spoken of previously because you don't switch out the images thrice.

c.)
imo the little white dots everywhere would look better behind the leaves. they would look like stars and the graphic becomes cleaner, imo


remember this is a great program! just that i thought there were a couple bugs or changes that could be made to make it look nicer. :)

I know why the comments on your program won't load! ski was recently ch@t b@nn@ned, and it seems that anywhere that the Gaurdians hid where he posted won't load, e.g. Dominic R.'s subpage your subpage, practically all of my programs, all Mountaintop threads (since ski was captain), etc. Evan Lewis told me to file a support ticket, but honestly I don't think that the KA Developers will be able to fix this quickly . . .

the only thing that I see that could be improved, is that the footer gets in the way of the content. would highly suggest instead of having a 'permanent' footer, just place it at the bottom of each page. :)

sadly this only allows you to have one WIP and stops you from creating a new program until you save the old one. honestly the best way to make a program stalker proof is to utilize __ ___ _______ ____ ___ _______ ______ _ ___ __ _____ and then ____ _ _________ ____ with the ___.

So I have this slight problem . . . I can't animate it so I'll just try to make some extra graphics for it. 

a.) I know this sounds like I am lazy, but I just don't have the time, motivation, etc. My activity levels are dropping off on Wednesday, and the amount of animating I would need to do to make it worth it would be impossible.
b.) I began working on it, and then I realized I had no clue how on earth to do some of the things, e.g. make the bunnies hop,
c.) my whole idea about the night/day thing is quite close to impossible . . . or at least for my patience and effort.

Now it sounds like I am whiny. lol, anyways I started working on some graphics, and changed some coordinates etc. in my spin-off.
• DATE: 4/12/2022, 8:30:25 AM
a.) all projects are unhidden for you, and it takes 10 more votes for Classical TD to overtake Blue. lol

c.) (if you had had more time) maybe change the background so it is a bit more detailed? or maybe this is just me being spoiled from all the sick backgrounds Ace Rogers gave me . . .

d.) two things come to mind when I see this.
1.) 'impending doom'

Great game, really liked it! One minor tip though many of the old programmers, especially the Non-Pirate, hate fake loading screens since some loading screens are actually used to load graphics for complex games.

A. Use rectMode(3); or rectMode(CENTER); instead of the x and y controlling the top left corner of the rectangle it controls the center allowing for better alignment. :D

B. noStroke(); strokes are unnecessary most of the time, except when you are using any strokeWeight above 1, e.g. 2, 5, 10, are all good strokes to use when needed.

C. Your 'Daedalus Programming' takes away from the project with the current font. You can also use textAlign(3,3); to help center it like rectMode(3); does. Try 'Consolas Bold' for a good font.

Okay here goes nothing.

"
1. Background is decent, about that emoji though. Emojis have a couple problems, lets start with one. 
a. They don't show up the same on all computers. The reason why many programmers avoid emojis is for this reason, windows computers and mac computers can't seem to agree about emojis and cause issues for many computers because people will see different versions of the same emoji.
b. It gets you much much more honor and attention if you code the emoji. Use the emoji as a reference image and then code it. It would look pretty stellar if you did that, and best yet works on _all_ computers. :D
3. Interactivity. Simple interactions go a long way with good graphics. Making a full game would be amazing. :D
4. Animation. Most likely not going to come in conjunction with Interactivity, but would be nice even for a simple sin(frameCount*10) animation. :D

I am pretty sure that all the greats are secretly following my plan to an extent even though they don't know they are. JSCoder is still around even though he _claims_ he isn't, I am pretty sure he is sticking around for Turkey Dash. xacer posted 4 days ago, and willard is still somewhat on, meaning my plan is ready now just to move forward with it.
Oh, and by the way if you want to learn some new stuff, go ask ski for ski.js or ES6 in PJS you will see that PJS has a little bit left to offer you.
Edit:
Xenon is on? My plans are coming together.

You don't find in the least bid odd, that you chose the 'purple-pi' avatar to represent rationality? Pi is an irrational number 3.141259 . . . so then it shouldn't represent rationality. I think I am starting to make sense ignore me.

Anyways, the internet is the internet.
• DATE: 3/1/2022, 10:47:13 AM
Seriously? I think I have already posted at least five times on how you need to stop clogging up the hotlist with these graphics. With so many CorinFist graphics on the hotlist poor ferrets won't have a chance to post anything, and start a riot. This riot will lead to crop-failure, bad internet, and the feared blue screen of death. You must stop before your diabolical actions go any further in causing an apocolyptical situation. Economies around the world would tank. Do you want to be responsible for the next Dark Age? How about the next Great Depression? Or even worse the next Covid-19 variant? If so please stop making these graphics.

It may not have been over then, but is it now?
P.S. I also suffer from lack of motivation, not thinking games through that is why all my games are made within a week less time to lose motivation and less stuff to plan out. If you want someone who doesn't lose motivation that would be ski who takes a month to make his mystery contest entry barely making it for the deadline (though unfortunately he didn't get picked and as he put it "they couldn't give a good reason why" for a Golden Winston)

So I am  not going to tell you that you plaigarized, but a little constructive critiscism.
1: Maybe a bit too much light?
2: The chair is floating
3: The light from the computer should be a fill(255,255,255,100); and then put the light at the bottom of the code before the CPU, the reason for this is there is a fourth parameter of fill that lets you control the transparency of the shape.making the light cast a glow on the human and other things it is over.
(Humorous From This Point on)
4: Green pants with a purple shirt? And I thought my fashion sense was bad.
5: Don't make the guy bald whatevere you do, just _don't_.

• DATE: 12/14/2021, 2:43:57 PM
Okay, I have a couple things and take these as feedback not offensive critiscism:

1: It is just text with a background nothing special to coding, yes my most voted program is similair but it was never meant to be that way, it was just an entry for a nespaper.

2: You could at least give it a font or something,

3: You are just riding on the message not the fact that you did something nobody else has done before or is at least something that is worth contributing, and you don't seem to try to stop people from voting

4: On side note, some of the messages are controversial, e.g. social media being a good thing, (many of which I don't agree with), this hasn't caused quite the stir because it hasn't gotten to many votes

5: Again side note thank you for reminding me in a round about way to switch my most voted program to something more than the text it was and the stop voting comment, which people didn't seem to take seriously.
