i think i misunderstood you.\nthe function `set` creates an `OffscreenCanvas` on line 1092 that ski.js uses to draw.\n\nit certainly does. lol, yeah, i do. the reason why i didn't overlay HTML for the HUD here is that i was on a time crunch an' didn't see the need to add an extra movin' part by interactin' with the DOM. is there a particular advantage of usin' the DOM over the canvas?\n\nwow, thank you, :D. means a lot to me comin' from you.\nuh, it needs way more comments to be well-commented, but the first few hundred lines are okay.","yessir, it does, :D!","that i'll see if i can fix. the issue has been that KA forces me to check the events for the entire DOM instead of just the canvas. i think someone else has a fix for that, so i'll see what i can do.\n\nthat is a simple fix, but i personally like it which is why it has persisted across all versions. you can disable it with one line.\n`canvas.onscoll = () => {}`\n\nthat's an easy fix. i'll change that in a pinch. i think you should be able to change `skiJSData`.\n\nski.js never claims to be the best canvas library for comprehensiveness an' dev experience. it isn't production-stable, so i think it's slightly unfair to treat it as a finished product. ski.js is the best canvas library overall when you consider efficiency, comprehensiveness, an' dev experience. if you want more comprehension an' mediocre performance, join the p5.js train. if you want crazy efficiency [much faster than ski.js] but a worse dev experience an' completely different from the PJS you're used to, PixiJS is the way to go.","i did.","knowledge only matters if you can apply it.\n\nsure someone scores a perfect score on a test, but when the curriculum is useless what good is the test score?\n\nsure i'm probs in the top 10 perhaps top 5 coderz on KA rn knowledge-wise, but i can't do the simple stuff like creatin' a new script element that sets the values of other elements in the DOM.\n\nwhat do i have to brag 'bout besides havin' a head filled with useless information?","paste this into a new webpage in a script with `type` set to `module`. if it doesn't work, then you've blocked pop-ups as it should work.\n\nif `window.fullscreen` exists [is truthy], set it to a constant `run`. else, run the fullscreen script where the new window has `window.fullscreen` set to a truthy value.\n\n```\nconst run = window.fullscreen || (function () {\n    const win = window.open()\n    win.document.open()\n    win.document.write(\"<!DOCTYPE html>\" + document.getElementsByTagName(\"html\")[0].outerHTML)\n    win.document.close()\n    win.fullscreen = true\n})()\n```","lol, or it means i have smol brain 'cuz it shouldn't be this hard.","no worries.\n\ni'll let him know. dunno if you could tell, but i hate admittin' defeat lol.\n\nnah, you're cool, :p.","JS is \"easy\" 'cuz it's a high level language.\nC doesn't count as low-level, not even close.\nthink Assembly an' then you're gettin' somewhere.","he's already messaged me privately on it.\n\nit's portin' to KA that's the issue. the entire thin' is done off-KA on another platform (CodeHS) due to KA hatin' CoffeeScript (forces me to save an' reload everytime a change is made). the issue is that CodeHS has my full name on it, an' i can't exactly share that link. there's a link i can share that shows the finished product w/o the code which i will produce when i release. the current issue is portin' to KA. it's all set up, but the issue with Liftoff's compiler was that it sent arguments passed into `fmt.Println` to the console an' i modified it to send to an element instead so the user didn't need to open the console (or in the case they didn't have access to the console). KA must hate the technique i used or it doesn't work in the sandbox idk which. if Liftoff could work on that, i _think_ that's it.","except have efficient code lol.","cocoa when it's 70 outside, o.O.\nthanks, :D! i hope i ace it, o.o.\nuh, i would let you see, but my name is currently on the project. it's stored off-KA rn due to weird KA environment-related issues that require me to save an' reload after every change, ;-;.\n\ni actually don't, but it sounds vaguely familiar, :p.\n\nglad to have a companion, :).\n\nyeah, :D!\nidk if i can beat my effort from last time lol.","stressed like always.\ncrazy busy week. gon' take the SATs on Wednesday, o.o.\ntryin' to finish the webpage for CoC. code is not cooperatin', >:(.\n\noh yeah.","furthermore, if you know how to use the modern syntax, you wouldn't be in the PJS environment.\n\ni _think_ i can do it live.\n\nhuh, i'll try my hand at it.\n\nbeen tryin' to figure out what `Program.settings` an' `Program.runTests` do. has anyone ever figured it out?

technically you're manipulatin' the DOM which should arguably [in the perspective of the Guardians an' their moderation] only be done in the web environment, so PixiJS, Paper.js, ski.js, etc. are all possibilities for the editor since you essentially stripped it down to its bones in the respect of the compiler.","the next round begins tuesday which is when you'll be replacin' Fer Fer, believe it or not, so i'll fill you in with any necessary details then, :).\n\nhow does it sound if i collect a list of tasks we need done an' you choose what you think you can get done?\n\nthank you for helpin' out!","no worries, :).\nthanks for considerin'; hope to see you 'round soon.","yeah...she's sketchy on activity an' gone 'till March 3rd, but givin' her activity levels with Liftoff, i don't think she's active enough to keep participatin'.\nworse than last year, i daresay.\n\nnah, that's cool, i understand where you're comin' from, :).","all good.","not sure if you noticed, but you haven't enabled discussions, :). ignore if you already knew, :p.\n\nnow i'm the one confused.","shouldn't that mean that we should stop regulatin' plagiarism under the same principles since those peepz should feel shame for the votes they garnered?

it's one thin' to plagiarize code off KA since you can find it through reasonable means [how many others programs were created in an outdated language], but what if a more experienced programmer copies large portions of their program from ChatGPT? it's more than capable of producin' algorithms that could take days to complete an' programmin' in a webpage rather than PJS would make ChatGPT even more powerful. as some of the council members are Guardians, they should know that the members of the KA community aren't always honest an' simply relyin' upon their morals isn't the best idea.\n\nrules are fine an' all, but they are only feared when they are enforced. i find this proposition of the council not only confusin' as Bob has stated but also impossible to enforce. there's no tool available on the internet that can accurately [key word] detect whether code was generated by an AI.","\"Oh pixel is the size of your pixels.\"\noh, that makes sense. as in i didn't know what my own code did an' you explained it to me.\n\n\"So there was no way around it :P\"\ni thought this was your response to the print.js fix, so my natural inclination was that KA's editor is garbage after a recent update as i didn't have to reload the page every time for the script to load for 1.8.3 but now i do.\n\nkernelz, :DDDD!\n\noh yeah!\n\nblur is easily the slowest lol.\nGPU faster than CPU, so why calculate on the CPU, o.O.","yup, =/. unless you use the same canvas for every filter an' naturally resettin' the `canvas` width an' height resets the `canvas` itself, :o.\n\nah, that might be it.\n\nthat's good?\n\nlol, known as the bad ski way, :p.\n\nGitHub or element[.]io if you have it.","lol, that sounds like a plan.","that makes sense.\nah, that makes sense.\nyup, =/. i hate KA's editor lol.","me have smol brain. me not know what `uv` coords are. me copy from WebGLFundamentals an' then play with it.\n\nmy definition of a pixel:\n```\nvec2 pixel = vec2(1.0, 1.0) / size;\n```","i have no clue how you would make it faster. i'm on a literal potato. it grew from the ground an' i plugged a couple wires in an' bam, a \"Chromebook\" they call it.\n\nyeah, you'll have to use `Promise`s for that.\n\ni think it's the initial setup behind the canvas API 'cuz they might optimize it for just the 2D context an' forget WebGL?
